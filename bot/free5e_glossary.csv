These astral forms use the targets’ game statistics and possessions. While in astral form the targets each trail a tether, a silvery-white cord that fades into immateriality a foot behind them. As long as the tether is not destroyed, a target can find their way back to their material body. If it is cut—which requires an effect specifically stating that it cuts your tether—the target immediately dies. Otherwise, damage and other effects on a target’s astral form have no effect on their material body either during this spell or after its duration ends. An astral form can travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through interplanar portals on the Astral Plane leading to any other plane. When a target leaves the Astral Plane, their material body and possessions are transported along the tether, allowing them to return fully intact to their body, with all their gear, as they enter the new plane. The spell ends for all targets when you use an action to dismiss it, for an individual target when a successful *Dispel Magic* is cast upon its astral form or material body, or when either its material body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points.

spell,Dominate Beast,"4th-level enchantment Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You assert control over one beast’s mind and it is charmed for the duration. If it is engaged in combat with you or creatures friendly to you, it has advantage on its saving throw. Until the charmed condition ends, you establish a telepathic link with it while you are on the same plane. You may issue commands through this link and the target does its best to obey. No action is required to issue commands, which can be a simple and general course of action such as “Attack that target,” “Go over there,” or “Bring me that object.” Without commands the target only defends itself. The target continues to follow a command until its task is complete. You can use your action to assume direct control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, you decide all of the target’s actions and movements. While a target is directly controlled in this way, you can also cause it to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new saving throw against the spell, ending the spell on a success. At Higher Levels. The spell’s duration is extended: 5th-level—Concentration (10 minutes), 6th-level—Concentration (1 hour), 7th-level—Concentration (8 hours)."

You can choose to let the messenger terrorize the target. The messenger can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you have a portion of the target’s body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the messenger’s fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents it from benefiting from the rest.

They may know that the overgrown path is in fact a well-maintained road, but are still impeded by illusory rocks and branches."
spell,Mirror Image,"2nd-level illusion Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: 1 minute A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear, sharing your space.

The target becomes charmed and incapacitated, though it can still hear you. Until the spell ends, any memories of an event that took place within the last 24 hours and lasted 10 minutes or less may be altered. Altering memories must adhere to the following parameters: • You may destroy the memory, have the target recall the event with perfect clarity, change specific details, or create a new memory that matches the timeframe and length. The target fills in gaps in details. • You must speak to the target in a language you both know to modify its memories and describe how the memory is changed • The memory must be logical and plausible to the creature or they are able to simply dismiss it as an obviously faulty memory • Modified memories will not necessarily change a creature’s behavior, especially if conflicts with the creature’s personality, beliefs, etc The spell automatically ends if the target takes any damage or if it is targeted by another spell. If the spell ends before you have finished modifying its memories, the alteration fails. Otherwise, the alteration is complete when the spell ends and only *greater restoration* or *remove curse* can restore the memory. There may be events that are unforgettable and utterly fundamental to a creature’s existence. After such memories are modified, they can be remembered correctly when another creature succeeds on a Persuasion check to stir the target’s memories. This check is made with disadvantage if the creature does not have indisputable proof on hand that is relevant to the altered memory. At Higher Levels. When using a 6th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 7 days ago. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 30 days ago.

Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spell’s light. On your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels. The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd."

For example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to include 20-foot-high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain elevation of 20 feet or less. Changes that result in unstable terrain are subject to collapse. Changes take 10 minutes to complete, after which you can choose another area to affect.

The creature’s behavior is optional, and you can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment. The task can range from simple to complex, and communication is required for bargaining. Payment can take various forms, such as gold, magic items, living sacrifices, or treasure. A task measured in minutes requires 100 gp per minute, in hours 1,000 gp per hour, and in days (up to 10 days) 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on circumstances. If the task aligns with the creature’s ethos, payment may be halved or waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require half the suggested payment, while dangerous tasks may require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept suicidal tasks. After completing the task or the agreed-upon duration, the creature returns to its home plane, reporting back if appropriate. If payment cannot be agreed upon, the creature returns immediately. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded."

If the target was summoned through some other means, like a spell, the duration of the original spell is extended to match this spell’s duration. Once it is bound to you the target serves as best it can and follows your orders, but only to the letter of the instruction. A hostile or malevolent target actively seeks to take any advantage of errant phrasing to suit its nature. When a target completes a task you’ve assigned to it, if you are on the same plane of existence the target travels back to you to report it has done so. Otherwise, it returns to where it was bound and remains there until the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When using a 6th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 10 days.

Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form. When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points."

spell,Shapechange,"9th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You take the form of a creature of a Challenge Rating equal to or lower than your level. The creature cannot be an undead or a construct, and it must be a creature you have seen. You change into the average version of that creature, and do not gain any class levels or the Spellcasting trait. Until the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit points, your statistics (except your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores) are replaced by those of the chosen creature. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies as well as gaining the creature’s, keeping the higher of the two if you share one in common. You keep all of your features, skills, and traits gained from your class, heritage, culture, background, or other sources, and can use them as long as the creature is physically able to do so. You do not keep any special senses, such as darkvision. You can only speak if the creature is typically capable of speech. You cannot use legendary actions or lair actions. Your gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you leave the form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If the spell’s effect on you ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form and knocks you unconscious if the damage reduces you to 0 hit points. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change into another form of your choice. The new form follows all the rules as the previous form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than your previous form, you keep the previous form’s hit points."

The image’s movement can be natural and lifelike. A creature that touches the image recognizes it as an illusion.

The duplicate looks exactly like the target and uses all the statistics of the original, though it is formed without any gear, and has only half of the target’s hit point maximum. The duplicate is a creature and can take actions. If the target is able to cast spells, the duplicate cannot cast spells of 7th-level or higher. The duplicate is friendly to you and your allies. It follows your orders, and moves and acts on your turn in combat. It is a static creature and it does not learn, age, or grow, so it never increases in levels and cannot regain any spent spell slots. When the simulacrum is damaged you can repair it in an alchemy lab using components worth 100 gold per hit point it regains. When reduced to 0 hit points the simulacrum crumbles into snow and melts away immediately. The simulacrum is also destroyed if you cast this spell again."

Starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets within the area fall unconscious in ascending order according to their hit points. Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends, they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake them. As each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target. A target’s hit points must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect. Constructs and undead are not affected by this spell. At Higher Levels.

Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted. A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it."

spell,Speak with Plants,"3rd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (30-foot radius) Components: V, S Duration: 10 minutes Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening plants in a 30-foot radius to limited sentience. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations. The targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain into difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation into ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an *entangle* spell. At the GM’s discretion the targets may be able to perform other tasks, though each must remain rooted in place.

The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration. Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round."

Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects: Round 2. Acid rain falls throughout the area dealing 1d6 acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud. Round 3. Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one bolt per creature or object). A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save. Round 4. Heavy hail falls throughout the area dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud. Round 5–10. Freezing rain and roiling winds turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud. When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration. Gusts of strong winds between 20–50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical).

When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 7 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year. When using a 9th-level spell slot, the suggestion lasts until it is dispelled.

Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation check against your spell save DC. Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it.

spell,Telekinesis,"5th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You move one Huge or smaller creature or object with the power of your mind. Until the spell ends you can use an action on subsequent turns to pick a new target or continue to affect the same target. Depending on whether you target a creature or an object, the spell has the following effects: Creature: The target makes a Strength check against your spell save DC or it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond the range of the spell. Object: You move the target 30 feet in any direction. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the target fails, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell. You can use *telekinesis* to finely manipulate objects as though you were using them yourself—you can open doors and unscrew lids, dip a quill in ink and make it write, and so on. At Higher Levels.

spell,Teleport,"7th-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet Components: V Duration: Instantaneous You and up to 8 willing creatures within 10 feet of you, or a single unattended object that fits entirely inside a 10-foot cube teleport instantly across vast distances. When you cast this spell, choose a destination. You must know the location you’re teleporting to, and it must be on the same plane of existence. Teleportation is difficult magic and you may arrive off-target or somewhere else entirely depending on how familiar you are with the location you’re teleporting to. When you teleport, the GM rolls 1d100 and consults Table: Teleport Familiarity. Familiarity is determined as follows: Permanent Circle: A permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know (see *teleportation circle*). Associated Object: You have an object taken from the target location within the last 6 months. Very Familiar: A place you have frequented, carefully studied, or can see at the time you cast the spell. Seen Casually: A place you have seen more than once but don’t know well. Viewed Once: A place you have seen once, either in person or via magic. Description: A place you only know from someone else’s description (whether spoken, written, or even marked on a map). False Destination: A place that doesn’t actually exist. Your arrival is determined as follows: On Target: You and your targets arrive exactly where you mean to. Off Target: You and your targets arrive some distance away from the target in a random direction. The further you travel, the further away you are likely to arrive. You arrive off target by a number of miles equal to 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the total distance of your trip. If you tried to travel 1,000 miles and roll a 2 and 4 on the d10s, you land 6 percent off target and arrive 60 miles away from your intended destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 to randomly determine the direction: 1—north, 2—northeast, 3—east, 4—southeast, 5—south, 6—southwest, 7—west, 8—northwest. Similar Location: You and your targets arrive in a different location that somehow resembles the target area. If you tried to teleport to your favorite inn, you might end up at a different inn, or in a room with much of the same decor. Typically you appear at the closest similar location, but not always. Mishap: The spell’s magic goes awry, and each teleporting creature or object takes 3d10 force damage. The GM rerolls on the table to determine where you arrive. When multiple mishaps occur targets take damage each time. <table> <tr> <td>Table: Teleport Familiarity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Familiarity</strong> </td> <td><strong>On Target</strong> </td> <td><strong>Off Target</strong> </td> <td><strong>Similar Location</strong> </td> <td><strong>Mishap</strong> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Permanent circle </td> <td>1–100 </td> <td>— </td> <td>— </td> <td>— </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Associated object </td> <td>1–85 </td> <td>86–95 </td> <td>96–100 </td> <td>— </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Very familiar </td> <td>1–76 </td> <td>77–87 </td> <td>88–95 </td> <td>96–100 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Seen casually </td> <td>1–47 </td> <td>48–57 </td> <td>58–67 </td> <td>68–100 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Viewed once </td> <td>1–27 </td> <td>28–47 </td> <td>48–57 </td> <td>58–100 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Description </td> <td>1–27 </td> <td>28–47 </td> <td>48–57 </td> <td>58–100 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>False destination </td> <td>— </td> <td>— </td> <td>01–50 </td> <td>51–100 </td> </tr> </table>"
spell,Teleportation Circle,"5th-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 minute Range: 10 feet Components: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: 1 round You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world. The portal remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly travels to the destination circle. Permanent teleportation circles are commonly found within royal palaces, major centers of commerce, and other important locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence. When you cast *teleportation circle*, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study. Casting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence. You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination."

You can make the transformation permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration. Creature into Creature: The target’s body is transformed into a creature with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn’t have a Challenge Rating, use its level. The target’s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells, though its personality remains unchanged. If the target is changed into a creature with an alignment trait, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it gains that alignment trait for the duration of the spell. Otherwise, it keeps its own alignment trait. The target’s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form. When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points. Object into Creature: The target is transformed into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size isn’t larger than the object’s size and it has a Challenge Rating of 9 or less. The creature is friendly to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns, but only . you dictate its actions and movement. However, the GM resolves the creature’s actions and movement and has its statistics. If the spell becomes permanent, your control over the creature ends. At this point its attitude towards you is determined by how you treated it previously. Creature into Object: You turn the target and whatever it is wearing and carrying into an object. The target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen object and it retains no memory of this time. When the spell ends it reverts to its previous form."

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation but must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenelations, battlements, and so on.

spell,Wish,"9th-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V Duration: Instantaneous You alter reality itself. The safest use of this spell is the duplication of any other spell of 8th-level or lower without needing to meet its requirements (including components). You may instead choose one of the following: • One nonmagical object of your choice that is worth up to 25,000 gold and no more than 300 feet in any dimension appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. • Up to 20 creatures that you can locate locate see to regain all their hit points, and each is further healed as per the *greater restoration* spell. • Up to 10 creatures that you can locate locate see gain resistance to a damage type you choose. • Up to 10 creatures you can locate locate see gain immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. • You force a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). At your discretion, the roll is made with advantage or disadvantage. You can choose to take either the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible, being very careful in your wording. Be aware that the greater the *wish*, the greater the chance for an unexpected result. This spell might simply fizzle, your desired outcome might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the *wish*. The GM has the final authority in ruling what occurs—and reality is not tampered with lightly. Multiple Wishes:* The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. Until finishing a long rest, each time you cast a spell you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented. In addition, your Strength drops to 3 for 2d4 days (if it isn’t 3 or lower already). For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33% chance that you are unable to cast *Wish* ever again."

On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth."
