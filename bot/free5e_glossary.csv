rule,Introduction,"Welcome to the Free5e Player’s Guide, brought to you by Wyrmworks Publishing. Our mission is to enhance inclusivity and accessibility in tabletop roleplaying. This guide is designed to help you create unique characters, embark on exciting adventures, and explore worlds where everyone can play, create, and share."
rule,How to Play,"Playing a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is all about imagining a character in a fantasy world and using dice to determine what happens. Here’s how it works:

**Choose a Game Master (GM). **One player is the GM, who creates the story, controls the world, and describes everything and everyone around you.

**Create Your Character.** Choose an ancestry, class, and background for your character. This is your hero in the game world!

**Playing an Encounter: **On your turn, you describe what your character does. Do you swing your sword, cast a spell, or talk to someone? To see whether you succeed, you roll a 20-sided die (d20) and add your ability score modifier and, maybe, a proficiency bonus. Higher rolls are better!

    **Grey (GM)**: The village elder has asked you to investigate a strange ruin in the nearby forest. After hours of travel, you arrive at a crumbling stone structure covered in moss. Inside, the air is damp, and faint echoes of scratching come from within the stony depths.. What do you do?

    **Susan (playing Sylvana, a halfling Bard)**: I step in quietly and take a closer look at the walls. Do I recognize any symbols or writing?

    **GM**: Make an Investigation check, using Intelligence.

    **Susan**: (Rolls d20) That’s a 12, plus 1 for Intelligence and 2 from my Investigation proficiency, so 15 total.

    **GM**: You recognize some faded symbols of an ancient order dedicated to protecting the forest. This was likely a Wodewose temple.

    **Owen (playing Osmus, a human Ranger)**: I listen closely to pinpoint where the scratching is coming from. Perception check?

    **GM**: Go ahead.

    **Owen**: (Rolls d20) I got a 10, plus 4 for Wisdom is 14.

    **GM**: The scratching is coming from behind a door at the far end of a corridor leading inside the temple.

    **Sylvana**: I cautiously open the door and peek inside.

    **GM**: The door creaks open, revealing dim light glinting off something large in the shadows. Its long, slimy tentacles sway as it shifts, and  its beak clicks. It hisses, sensing you. Perched on the ceiling, it stares down.

    **Osmus**: What is that thing? It looks dangerous!

    **GM**: It’s certainly not friendly. Roll Initiative! (Rolls d20) With its Dexterity bonus, it gets a 9.

    **Osmus:** (Rolls d20) 9, plus 3 for Dexterity is 12.

    **Sylvana**: (Rolls d20) 15! I’m first! I try to confuse it with a quick spell. I cast Vicious Mockery, shouting, ‘You look like something the forest spit out!’ It needs to make a Wisdom saving throw.

    **GM**: (Rolls for the creature) That’s a 6. It fails.

    **Sylvana**: (Rolls 1d4) It takes 3 psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack!

    **GM**: The creature seems momentarily stunned, its many eyes narrowing as it hisses. Osmus, your turn!

    **Osmus**: I fire an arrow at it! (Rolls d20) That’s a 17, plus 5 to hit. Does that hit?

    **GM**: Yes, that hits. Roll for damage.

    **Osmus**: (Rolls 1d8) That’s a 2, but I add my Dexterity so that’s a total 5 damage!

    **GM**: The arrow strikes true, but the creature’s tough hide absorbs some of the blow. It lunges with its tentacles!

    **GM (as the creature)**: (Rolls to attack Osmus with the tentacles) That’s a 22 to hit versus your Armor Class.

    **Osmus**: Ouch, I’ve only got 15 so that hits!

    **GM**: (Rolls for damage) You take 10 bludgeoning damage, and I need you to make a Strength saving throw to avoid being pulled in.

    **Osmus**: (Rolls d20) That’s a 14, plus 3 for Strength, so 17.

    **GM**: You hold your ground, but the creature’s tentacles are still trying to wrap around you. It’ll try again. What’s your next move?

    **Sylvana**: I step back and cast Command on the creature and shout “Flee!” to force it to flee! It needs to make a Wisdom saving throw, DC 13.

    **GM**: (Rolls for the creature) That’s a 9. It fails!

    **Sylvana**: It must use its reaction to move as far away as possible!

    **GM**: The creature screeches in pain, skittering across the ceiling to the far corner, giving you space. It looks weakened but still dangerous.

    **Osmus**: Let’s finish this!

The battle continues, with the party using teamwork and clever spells to face down the fearsome creature!

In every game, describe your actions, roll dice to succeed, and react to the unfolding story. The rules guide you, but the fun comes from your shared stories. Let your imagination soar!"
rule,Creating a Character,"As a player, begin by creating a character on the character sheet in the back of this book or a color-coded one at [LINK]. If you're using a paper copy, we recommend writing in an erasable medium like pencil.

1. Think of a fantasy character concept that you'd like to play
2. Choose your class
3. Choose your ancestry
4. Choose your heritage
5. Choose your background
6. Determine ability scores
7. Choose your starting equipment
8. Choose starting spells if applicable
9. Add details like appearance, personality, etc. Consider drawing a picture of your character. It doesn't have to be fancy! It's just for your friends! (If you'd like to commission a professional portrait of your character, check the credits of this book for some great artists who love illustrating characters!)"

Class Features,Rage,"In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

    ●  	You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

    ●  	When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a Dreadnought, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Dreadnought table.

    ●  	You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your Dreadnought level in the Rages column of the Dreadnought table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again."
Class Features,Unarmored Defense,"While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit."
Class Features,Reckless Attack,"Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn."
Class Features,Danger Sense,"At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can locate locate can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated."
Class Features,Dreadnought Path,"At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Class Features,Extra Attack,"Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn."
Class Features,Fast Movement,"Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor."
Class Features,Feral Instinct,"By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn."
Class Features,Brutal Critical,"Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level."
Class Features,Relentless Rage,"Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10."
Class Features,Persistent Rage,"Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it."
Class Features,Indomitable Might,"Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total."
Class Features,Primal Champion,"At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24."
Dreadnought,Dreadnought Paths,
Dreadnought Paths,Path of the Berserker,"For some Dreadnoughts, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being."
Path of the Berserker,Frenzy,"Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A)."
Path of the Berserker,Mindless Rage,"Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage."
Path of the Berserker,Intimidating Presence,"Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can locate locate can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can locate locate  see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours."
Path of the Berserker,Retaliation,"Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature."
Dreadnought Paths,Path of the Dragon,"Dreadnoughts tap into primal powers, and a Dreadnought of this path taps into one of the most ancient and primeval of them all: the power of dragons. Some say this path was born during the rage of dragons by mortals tapping into the primal rage as it washed across the world, others say that only those with latent dragon blood coursing through them can walk this path. What all can agree on is the result is a being to be feared.

As with most Dreadnought paths, ones following this path tend toward chaos, as they contain potent destructive power that paces at the edges of the cage, just waiting to be unleashed. Some, particularly those rare individuals that channel metallic colors, may be exceptions to this tendency."
Path of the Dragon,Path of the Dragon Features,"When you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can choose to make your Rage bonus damage deal elemental damage matching your draconic type (shown on the table below).

Additionally, when you enter a rage you can take on aspects of a draconic entity, growing vicious natural weapons as claws grow from your hands, fangs sprout from your maw, and a vicious lashing tail grows from your back. Your claws deal 1d4 slashing damage. Your fangs deal 1d8 piercing damage, and your lashing tail deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the reach property.

Whenever you attack with one of these natural weapons using the Attack action on your turn, if you are not carrying any weapon or shield, you can make a single unarmed strike with your claws as a bonus action.

When you gain this feature, you pick a color, and gain resistance corresponding to the element type of that color on the following Path of the Dragon Elements table below while raging."
Path of the Dragon,Path of the Dragon Elements,"Dragon Color | Element Type
Black | Acid
Blue | Lightning
Green | Poison
Red | Fire
White | Cold"
Path of the Dragon,Unleashed Brutality,"Starting at 6th level, once during a rage, as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can unleash your rage into pure energy, exhaling a blast of elemental power. Creatures within a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your strength modifier. A creature takes 6d6 damage of the Elemental Type of your Dragon Color on a failed save. The damage and range of this breath weapon increases at 10th level (to 8d6 in a 30-foot cone), at 14th level (10d6 in a 45-foot cone), and at 18th level (12d6 in a 60 foot cone)"
Path of the Dragon,Primal Weapons,"Additionally at 6th level, the natural weapons you gain while raging now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage."
Path of the Dragon,Dragonhide,"Starting at 10th level, the marks of your Draconic path now remain outside of your rage, manifesting as heavy scales that grant you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources even when you are not raging. Additionally, you gain resistance to your dragon color’s elemental type even when you are not raging."
Path of the Dragon,Tyrant of the Skies,"By 14th level, when you enter a rage, you can sprout massive dragon wings from your back. If you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed.

If you choose to manifest natural weapons and wings when you enter a rage, you can choose to entirely take on a draconic form while raging, becoming Large sized. When you take on a full draconic form, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it."
Classes,Bard,"Bards channel creativity into magic, shaping the world through speech, movement, or craft."
Bard,Class Features,"As a Bard, you gain the following class features."
Class Features,Hit Points,"**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Bard level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

Class Features,Spellcasting,"You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations."
Spellcasting,Cantrips,"You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. You learn additional Bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table."
Spellcasting,Spell Slots,"The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Cure Wounds using either slot."
Spellcasting,Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher,"You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more Bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots."
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Ability,"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier"

Spellcasting,Spellcasting Focus,You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells.

The creature gains a Bardic Inspiration die (d6) to add to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw within the next 10 minutes, after seeing the d20 roll but before knowing the outcome. Each creature can only have one die at a time. You have a number of uses equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one), regaining expended uses after a long rest.

Bardic Inspiration die size increases at levels 5 (d8), 10 (d10), and 15 (d12)."

If you or any friendly creatures who can locate locatecan hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

Class Features,Superior Inspiration,"At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use."
Bard,Bard Colleges,
Bard Colleges,College of Lore,"Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these Bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of these Bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a Bard as a herald or advisor knows that the Bard would rather be honest than politic.

The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority."
College of Lore,Bonus Proficiencies,"When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice."
College of Lore,Cutting Words,"Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can locate locate can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear (or see if you’re using a sign language) you or if it’s immune to being charmed."
College of Lore,Additional Magical Secrets,"At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as Bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of Bard spells you know."
College of Lore,Peerless Skill,"Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail."
Bard Colleges,College of Fools,"The College of Fools is a motley lot, varying from bumbling beggars to the eyesores of a noble court, decked out in the finest eye-bleeding frippery. One can tell at a glance they are not to be taken seriously, but beneath the facade there is... well, usually a fool, but also a sharp mind, quick hands, and an uncanny understanding of how to manipulate any situation.

The College of Fools is tolerated much like an assassin’s guild might be: a useful menace to society. Hiding in the brilliant outfits in plain sight more surely than darkened leather could hide them in the shadows, they gather information, poke and prod their enemies, and—just occasionally—toss a knife in the air and forget to catch it before it hits someone."
College of Fools,College of Fools Features,
College of Fools,Jester’s Juggling,"When you join the College of Fools at 3rd level, you master the art of juggling almost anything. You gain proficiency in Performance (or another skill of your choice if you are already proficient in it).

Additionally, you can draw or stow any number of items or weapons during your turn. You can hold more weapons or objects than you have hands, but when you do so, at the end of your turn you must make Dexterity (Performance) check with a DC of 5 times the additional number of hands you need to wield or hold all the items you are holding (for example, to hold 3 daggers would be a DC 5, while to hold 3 daggers and greatsword would be DC 15). On failure, you drop any that you don’t have sufficient hands to hold."
College of Fools,Fool’s Fumble,"Additionally at 3rd level, when you fail an ability check or attack roll, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to pass it off as an intentional failure, recovering in spectacular fashion. When you do so, reroll the check or attack roll and add your Bardic Inspiration to the result."
College of Fools,Acrobatic Antics,"Starting at 6th level, your acrobatic mastery gives you proficiency in Acrobatics (or another skill of your choice if you are already proficient in it). You can use your acrobatic foolery to tumble around the most dangerous places safely. You gain the following benefits:

    ●  	**Acrobatic Movement.** You gain a climbing speed of 20 feet, and falls of 20 feet or less deal no damage to you. Whenever you fall, you can choose to land on your feet (rather than fall prone).

    ●  	**Tumble.** As a bonus action, you can leap and tumble, spending up to 10 feet of movement while ignoring difficult terrain, not provoking opportunity attacks, and moving through creatures’ spaces (including hostile creatures).

    ●  	**Balance.** You gain advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to avoid falling or being knocked prone."
College of Fools,Fatal Flourish,"Additionally at 6th level, when you use your Action to make an ability check, cast Vicious Mockery, or make a weapon attack with a melee weapon, you can make a single weapon attack with a light melee weapon or dart as bonus action."
College of Fools,Energetic Encore,"Starting at 14th level, you can build off the success of others and encourage them to greater heights. When another creature scores a critical hit while within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against the same target. When you deal a critical hit or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells by 5 or more, you can use your reaction to take the Help action to encourage an ally to follow up on success. You can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to take one of these reactions on any hit or failed save, even when the attack was not a critical hit."

Class Features,Spellcasting,"As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Cleric spells."
Spellcasting,Cantrips,"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. You learn additional Cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table."
Spellcasting,Preparing and Casting Spells,"The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level Cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list."
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Ability,"Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a Cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier"
Spellcasting,Ritual Casting,You can cast a Cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Focus,"You can use a holy symbol (see chapter XX, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your Cleric spells."
Cleric,Divine Domain,"Choose one domain related to your deity. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels."
Divine Domain,Domain Spells,"Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the Cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the Cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Cleric spell for you."
Cleric,Channel Divinity,"At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your Cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses."
Channel Divinity,Channel Divinity: Turn Undead,"As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can locate locate  see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action."
Cleric,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Cleric,Destroy Undead,"Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR...
5th | 1/2 or lower
8th | 1 or lower
11th | 2 or lower
14th | 3 or lower
17th | 4 or lower"
Cleric,Divine Intervention,"Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required."

Life Domain,Channel Divinity: Preserve Life,"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct."
Life Domain,Blessed Healer,"Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level."
Life Domain,Divine Strike,"At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8."
Life Domain,Supreme Healing,"Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12."
Cleric Domains,Martyr Domain,"Followers of gods that believe in taking on the suffering of those around them.

Martyr Domain,Relieve Suffering,"Starting at 1st level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points, you can expend some of your own hit points to increase the amount another creature that is healed by the spell regains, expending a number of hit points up to your Cleric level to increase the amount one creature is healed by an equivalent value.

Additionally, you can touch a creature suffering a disease or the blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned condition and transfer that disease or condition to yourself. Starting at 9th level, the range of conditions you can take increases, including exhaustion (1 level at a time), petrified, stunned, the effect of a curse, or any reduction to their ability scores. You are afflicted by the effect in the same manner the creature you took it was, for the same duration and possible methods of ending the effect.

You can transfer a condition affecting another creature to yourself a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses on a long rest."
Martyr Domain,Channel Divinity: Bear the Burden,"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bring all the suffering your allies suffer onto yourself.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and enter a divine trance. Until the start of your next turn, your movement speed becomes zero and you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Cleric level. Any time an allied creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, they have resistance to the damage taken, but you take damage equal to the damage they take."
Martyr Domain,Overcome Adversity,"Starting at 6th level, when you use your Relieve Suffering to take the condition affecting a creature, you can repeat the original saving throw against the feature if it had one. On success, the condition ends instead of being transferred.

Additionally, when you take damage as a result of the Warding Bond spell, you have resistance to that damage."
Martyr Domain,Divine Empowerment,"At 8th level, pick one of the following options:"
Martyr Domain,Divine Strike,"At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack made as part of the attack action, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target.

You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic."
Class Features,Spellcasting,"Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will."
Spellcasting,Cantrips,"At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Wodewose spell list. You learn additional Wodewose cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wodewose table."

To cast one of these Wodewose spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Wodewose,Timeless Body,"Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year."
Wodewose,Beast Spells,"Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your Wodewose spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a Wodewose spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components."
Wodewose,Elder Wose,"At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your Wodewose spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape."
Wodewose,Sacred Plants and Wood,"A Wodewose holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Wodewoses often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.

Similarly, a Wodewose uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for sabers or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.

Wodewoses from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a Wodewose of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants."
Wodewose,Wodewose Circles,
Wodewose Circles,Circle of the Land,"The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These Wodewoses meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Wodewose. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites."
Circle of the Land,Bonus Cantrip,"When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional Wodewose cantrip of your choice."
Circle of the Land,Natural Recovery,"Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Wodewose level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level Wodewose, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots."

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell."
Circle of the Land,Nature’s Ward,"When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease."
Circle of the Land,Nature’s Sanctuary,"When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Wodewose spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you."
Wodewose Circles,Circle of the City,"The circle of the city is about adaption. The adaption of nature to cities, and the adaption of cities to nature. Wodewoses of the circle see the teeming life of the city as just another ecosystem, one adapted to a special type of life, feeling kinship with the creatures that thrive in such an environment, particularly that which remains wild in the heart of the city, such as rats, pigeons, and cats. While more primeval Wodewoses may view them as scarcely different to other city-dwellers, they are no less in tune with nature than other Wodewoses, simply tuning into a different, more subtle and pervasive, frequency."
Circle of the City,Circle of City Features,
Circle of the City,Circle Spells,"Your adaptation to the urban environment gives you access to certain avenues of magic that are most helpful for overseeing the interests of nature in such an environment. At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the City Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the Wodewose spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Wodewose spell for you."

When a tiny animal is charmed in this way, they can understand you in a limited capacity (such as where something you can describe in terms they would understand is), you can understand them in a limited capacity (such as which direction something is), and will lend you aid in simple tasks as long as it does not place them in danger. They can be convinced to take on greater risks with an appropriate Animal Handling check with the DC determined by the GM. Additionally, any familiar you summon with Find Familiar gains the ability to communicate with creatures of a type resembling the form it takes, and has advantage on all Animal Handling checks while interacting with beasts it can communicate with. You can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to shift your familiar from one form it can take to another without having to resummon it as a bonus action."
Circle of the City,Controlled Magic,"Additionally at 2nd level, from operating within the confines of a city, you have managed to tame your magic to more freely operate within the limitations of tight urban environments. When you cast a spell that targets an area of effect, you can exclude a 10-foot cube from the area of effect (the cube does not have to be entirely within the area of effect). Alternatively, you can reduce the area of effect of any spell down to any value between its area of effect and a 5-foot radius, and can cast spells that would otherwise not be able to manifest in the environment (such as casting Call Lightning in a room less than 60 feet tall), with your spells adapting to fit within your environment."
Circle of the City,Civilized Beasts,"Starting at 6th level, when you use your Wild Shape feature to take on the form of a beast, you retain your ability to speak (as long as the beast would normally be able to vocalize sounds at sufficient volume to do so), and become more dexterous and adaptable with paws, claws, or talons, allowing you to use them perform more complicated tasks that might otherwise require hands. You additionally retain the ability to cast spells while using Wild Shape to turn into a beast."
Circle of the City,Spellcasting Beasts,"The civilized beasts feature means that you would be able to cast spells (performing verbal and somatic components) while Wild Shaped (among other uses, such as talking to your parties and performing side talking animal circus side show acts."
Circle of the City,Urban Adaptation,"Starting at 10th level, you become immune to poison and disease, and gain one skill of your choice from Insight, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. If you have all the listed skills, you can select any skill of your choice instead."
Circle of the City,Keen Skills,"Starting at 14th level, you gain proficiency in an additional skill from the list in Urban Adaptation. Additionally, if a beast you assume the form of is proficient in a skill you are normally proficient in, you gain expertise in that skill while transformed into that beast."

Martial Archetypes,Brawler,"A brawler is a Fighter that takes a holistic approach to beating things down. They are not the specialized martial artists of Adepts, but can throw a punch... or a chair. They specialize in being resourceful and, more importantly, strong. Ranging from brutish thugs and drunks to witty chaps who had to learn to wag their fists as fast as their tongue to keep their head on their shoulders.

A brawler is always armed and dangerous, and isn’t above using a weapon if it’s the handiest way to bash something; they just don’t view themselves as limited to traditional options."
Brawler,Weapon is a State of Mind,"Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a remarkable ability to turn anything into a weapon—fists, improvised weapons, goblins, etc. You can add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with improvised weapons, and all attacks you make with them deal 1d8 damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending on their nature) if their damage die would be smaller. You can use creatures you are grappling as improvised weapons with the Thrown 5/10 property. If they are one or more sizes smaller than you, they gain the Light property. When you make an attack using a creature or object as a weapon, you can choose to deal damage equal to your Strength modifier to the creature or object you are using as a weapon."
Brawler,Flexible Style,"Additionally at 3rd level, you can apply the benefit of any Fighting Style you know to any weapon attack (including unarmed strikes and improvised weapons).

Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest."

Class Features,Unarmored Defense,"Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier."
Class Features,Martial Arts,"At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and Adept weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Adept weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

    ●  	You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and Adept weapons.

    ●  	You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or Adept weapon. This die changes as you gain Adept levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Adept table.

    ●  	When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or an Adept weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the Adept weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for an Adept weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon."
Class Features,Focus,"Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus points. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your Adept level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Adept table.

You can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.

Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier"
Focus,Flurry of Blows,"Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action."
Focus,Patient Defense,You can spend 1 focus point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
Focus,Step of the Wind,"You can spend 1 focus point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn."
Class Features,Unarmored Movement,"Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Adept levels, as shown in the Adept table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move."
Class Features,Martial Discipline,"When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a Martial Discipline. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level."
Class Features,Deflect Missiles,"Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Adept level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as an Adept weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Class Features,Slow Fall,"Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your Adept level."
Class Features,Extra Attack,"Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn."
Class Features,Stunning Strike,"Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of focus in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn."
Class Features,Focus-Empowered Strikes,"Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage."
Class Features,Evasion,"At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a Fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail."
Class Features,Stillness of Mind,"Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened."
Class Features,Purity of Body,"At 10th level, your mastery of the focus flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison."
Class Features,Tongue of the Sun and Moon,"Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the focus of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say."
Class Features,Diamond Soul,"Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of focus grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll it and take the second result."
Class Features,Timeless Body,"At 15th level, your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water."
Class Features,Empty Body,"Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 focus points to cast the Astral Projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you."
Class Features,Perfect Self,"At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no focus points remaining, you regain 4 focus points."
Adept,Martial Disciplines,"Many traditions of disciplinary pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor multiple traditions and instruct each Adept according to his or her aptitude and interest. All traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more Adept. Thus, an Adept need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level."
Martial Disciplines,Discipline of the Open Hand,"Adepts of the Discipline of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate focus to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm."
Discipline of the Open Hand,Open Hand Technique,"Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s focus when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

    ●  	It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

    ●  	It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.

    ●  	It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn."
Discipline of the Open Hand,Wholeness of Body,"At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your Adept level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again."
Discipline of the Open Hand,Tranquility,"Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a Sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus."
Discipline of the Open Hand,Quivering Palm,"At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 focus points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Adept level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action."
Martial Disciplines,Discipline of the Outcast,"An Outcast is an Adept that has lost their Way. Trained in the basics of the style, they have abandoned the rigorous discipline and philosophy of their tradition, and are usually now enrolled only in the school of hard knocks. Having been trained in the fundamentals of the art of focus points, these Adepts choose as often as not to apply that art to tavern brawls and street fights. Much to the horror of many more formal Adepts, their rough and tumble lifestyle tends to be a solid source of further training."
Discipline of the Outcast,Discipline of the Outcast Features,
Discipline of the Outcast,Off the Wagon,"Meditating to regain your focus points can now include

things such as playing cards, drinking ale, smoking

leafy matter of various types, or other relaxing

activities that reset the stress of all that punching."
Discipline of the Outcast,Bonus Proficiencies,"At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Athletics skill,

or another skill of your choice if you are already

proficient in Athletics.

**Pragmatism**

At 3rd level, you embrace a more pragmatic view,

gaining the following benefits:

          	**Improvised Adept Weapons.** You have proficiency in improvised weapons. Improvised melee weapons count as Adept weapons for you.

          	**Matter Over Mind.** You gain proficiency in light armor and medium armor, and gain the benefits of Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement while wearing it.

          	**Function Over Form.** You can use your Strength modifier in place of your Wisdom modifier for calculating your focus Save DC.

You gain the following additional Pragmatic Techniques you can spend focus on.

**Kick ‘em While They’re Down (1 focus point).** When you hit a target that is prone, restrained, or incapacitated, you can expend a focus point to deal additional damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

**Unexpected Technique (1 focus point).** When you make a grapple check, you can expend a focus point to add your Martial Arts die to the roll. You can do this after the contested roll, and it can potentially turn a failure into a success. On success, the target takes damage equal to the amount rolled on the added die."
Discipline of the Outcast,Soak It Up,"At 6th level, your extensive training in the art of getting hit with bar stools and broken bottles grants you increased endurance. When you roll initiative you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points are refreshed any time you take the Dodge action."
Discipline of the Outcast,Where It Hurts,"At 11th level, when you use Stunning Strike on a critical hit or on an attack made against an enemy that was unaware of you, the target has disadvantage on their saving throw against being stunned."
Discipline of the Outcast,Lean into It,"At 17th level, you have thrown your fair share of walloping hits, and know how to make them reliably. You can forgo adding your proficiency bonus to an attack roll with an unarmed strike or melee Adept weapon. When you do so, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to the damage roll."
Discipline of the Outcast,How Outcasts Come to Be,"How an Adept becomes an Outcast can vary—maybe they only ever received incomplete training from a passing mentor that died or left, or maybe they were outright expelled from their Order. Alternatively, at your DM's discretion this could be a later in life development if a player becomes disenchanted with their Martial Discipline."
Classes,Vanguard,"Vanguards channel divine strength, standing as unyielding champions of causes greater than themselves."
Vanguard,Class Features,"As a Vanguard, you gain the following class features."
Class Features,Hit Points,"**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per Vanguard level

Class Features,Divine Sense,"The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses."
Class Features,Lay on Hands,"Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your Vanguard level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs."
Class Features,Fighting Style,"At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again."

Fighting Style,Dueling,"When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon."
Fighting Style,Great Weapon Fighting,"When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit."
Fighting Style,Protection,"When a creature you can locate locate can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield."
Class Features,Spellcasting,"By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a Cleric does."
Spellcasting,Preparing and Casting Spells,"The Vanguard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your Vanguard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Vanguard spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Vanguard spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Vanguard spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Vanguard level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level Vanguard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Vanguard spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list."
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Ability,"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Vanguard spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Vanguard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier"
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Focus,You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Vanguard spells.
Class Features,Divine Smite,"Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend."
Class Features,Divine Health,"By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease."
Class Features,Oath of Duty,"When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a Vanguard forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature."
Class Features,Oath Spells,"Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the Vanguard spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Vanguard spell for you."
Class Features,Channel Divinity,"Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your Vanguard spell save DC."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Class Features,Extra Attack,"Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn."
Class Features,Aura of Protection,"Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet."
Class Features,Aura of Courage,"Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet."
Class Features,Improved Divine Smite,"By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite."
Class Features,Cleansing Touch,"Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest."
Vanguard,Oaths of Duty,"Becoming a Vanguard involves taking vows that commit the Vanguard to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when they reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the Vanguard's training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Vanguards until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the Vanguard's heart."
Oaths of Duty,Oath of Devotion,"The Oath of Devotion binds a Vanguard to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, the Vanguards meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms."
Oath of Devotion,Tenets of Devotion,"Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, Vanguards of this oath share these tenets.

**Honesty.** Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

**Courage.** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

**Compassion.** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

**Honor.** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

**Duty.** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you."
Oath of Devotion,Oath Spells,"Level | Vanguard Spells
3rd | Protection From Evil And Good, Sanctuary
5th | Lesser Restoration, Zone of Truth
9th | Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic
13th | Freedom of Movement, Guardian of Faith
17th | Commune, Flame Strike"
Oath of Devotion,Channel Divinity,"When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

**Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can locate locate  see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action."
Oath of Devotion,Aura of Devotion,"Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet."
Oath of Devotion,Purity of Spirit,"Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a Protection from Evil and Good spell."
Oath of Devotion,Holy Nimbus,"At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."
Oaths of Duty,Oath of Silence,"The Oath of Silence is taken by those that have seen the chaos of the world and have chosen to take a stand. Rather than shout over the clamor, they lead by example and action, showing that the world needs not fiery rhetoric or the manipulations of honeyed words, but people to act as they should with purpose and pride.

Vanguards of this oath can come from many backgrounds and espouse endless variants of their conviction, but most often tend to be Lawful. They often believe that the power of words should be in the reason and virtue they carry, rather than volume or, worst of all, manipulating magics that twist the minds of those they fall on."
Oath of Silence,Tenets of Silence,"Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Silence vary, Vanguards of this oath share these tenets.

**Temperance.** Whispering in silence conveys greater power than shouting in clamor.

**Precision.** Speak with purpose and say what must be said.

**Sanctuary.** Be the port in the storm, be the tranquility in the chaos.

**Purpose.** Actions speak louder than words. Let your sword and shield be your voice.

**Sacred.** Be wary of those that use their voice to bend the world to their will for their own gain, and rebuke those that use their voice to bend creatures to their will for their own gain."
Oath of Silence,Oath of Silence Features,
Oath of Silence,Channel Divinity,"When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**Shroud of Silence.** As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and whisper a prayer, shrouding one creature within 60 feet in an aura of silence. For 10 minutes, the target makes no noise. It cannot speak (including the verbal components of spells) and gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks. An unwilling creature makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to prevent the effect when targeted, and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect on a success.

**Sanctuary of the Sacrosanct.** As an action, you present your holy symbol and whisper prayer to bring refugees from the turmoil of the world. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet gain temporary hit points equal to your Vanguard level + your Charisma modifier, and if they are under the effect of a condition or spell they can normally save against the end of their turn, they can immediately make a save against the effect, ending it on success as normal."
Oath of Silence,Oath Spells,"Vanguard Level | Spells
3rd | Sanctuary, Sleep
5th | Blindness/Deafness, Silence
9th | Counterspell, Dispel Magic
13th | Banishment, Divination
17th | Hallow, Mislead"
Oath of Silence,Aura of Serenity,"Starting at 7th level, you permeate an aura of quiet serenity, reducing the volume of all noises within 10 feet. You and friendly creatures in the aura gain resistance to thunder damage, and armor does not give disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for creatures within the aura. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet."
Oath of Silence,Rebuke,"Starting at 15th level, when a creature within your Aura of Serenity attempts to speak, attack, or cast a spell, you can rebuke them as a reaction, causing them to take radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier and forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw their attempt to speak fails, and they are silenced until the start of their next turn."
Oath of Silence,Ordered World,"At 20th level, as an action, you can bring ordered tranquility to the world around you for 1 minute. Your Aura of Serenity doubles in size, and you can use Rebuke without expending your reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining all uses at the start of your next turn. For the duration, all creatures of your choice have advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened conditions, or the effects of spells."
Oath of Silence,Optional Feature: Vow of Silence,"Some Vanguards of this oath take their calling very seriously, and commit to never speaking again. When you select this option, you gain the ability to speak telepathically to creatures with which you share at least one language with a range of 60 feet. This telepathy is one way, and they cannot reply. Additionally, all verbal components of spells (as well as the whispered prayers of your Channel Divinity options) are replaced by somatic components for you. If you ever speak, this vow is broken, and you lose these additional powers."
Vanguard,Breaking Your Oath,"A Vanguard tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous Vanguard is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a Vanguard to transgress his or her oath.

A Vanguard who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a Cleric who shares his or her faith or from another Vanguard of the same order. The Vanguard might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the Vanguard starts fresh.

If a Vanguard willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent Vanguard might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another."

Class Features,Favored Enemy,"Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two ancestries of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures."

Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

    ●  	Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.

    ●  	Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.

    ●  	Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more Ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots."
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Ability,"Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Excelling at hunting down targets wherever they should hide, they bring them down dead or alive."

9th | Speak With Dead
13th | Arcane Eye
17th | Hold Monster"
Bounty Hunter,Urban Tracker,"Starting at 3rd level, you excel at tracking prey even if they take refuge in the trappings of society. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to tracking a creature in cities or towns, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. You can only gain this benefit if you are familiar with the target’s ancestry or general appearance (such as a sketch from a wanted poster)."

Bounty Hunter,Repairing Nets,"Nets are heavy and expensive. A subclass that utilizes them will often want to repair them. Whether this is possible is up to the GM, but a reasonable value would be allowing a net to be repaired in 1 hour with 5 feet of rope (allowing for the repair of 2 nets during a typical long rest if that was the selected activity)."
Bounty Hunter,Quick Throw,"Starting at 7th level, when you use a net as part of your Attack action, you can make the normal number of attacks, though you can only make one of those attacks with a net."

Class Features,Expertise,"At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. You gain expertise with the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit."
Class Features,Sneak Attack,"Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table."
Class Features,Thieves’ Cant,"During your Rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run."
Class Features,Cunning Action,"Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action."
Class Features,Roguish Archetype,"At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your Rogue abilities. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature."
Class Features,Uncanny Dodge,"Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can locate locate can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you."
Class Features,Evasion,"Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail."
Class Features,Reliable Talent,"By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10."
Class Features,Blindsense,"Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you."
Class Features,Slippery Mind,"By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws."
Class Features,Elusive,"Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated."
Class Features,Stroke of Luck,"At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest."
Rogue,Roguish Archetypes,"Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different Rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the Rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype reflects your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques."
Roguish Archetypes,Thief,"You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do Rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ."
Thief,Fast Hands,"Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action."
Thief,Second-Story Work,"When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier."
Thief,Supreme Sneak,"Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn."
Thief,Use Magic Device,"By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, ancestry, and level requirements on the use of magic items."
Thief,Thief’s Reflexes,"When you reach 17th level, you have become Adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised."
Roguish Archetypes,Assassin,"You specialize in the grim art of dealing death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: assassins, hired killers, spies, bounty hunters and more."
Assassin,Assassin Features,
Assassin,Bonus Proficiency,"When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with your choice of either disguise kit or poisoner’s kit."
Assassin,Backstab,"Starting at 3rd level, you are pragmatic and deadly in eliminating your foes. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet, or when an allied creature within 5 feet of the target is directly on the other side of a creature."
Assassin,Killer’s Method,"Starting at 9th level, you have mastered one

technique of your choice for approaching a target.

Select one of the following benefits:

    ●  	False Face. You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the disguise kit, and can assume a prepared disguise with the bonus action granted by Cunning Action.

    ●  	Blade in the Dark. You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the Stealth skill. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by dim light.

    ●  	Poisoner’s Path. You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the poisoner’s kit. During a long rest, you can create a long lasting poison for one or more weapons for free. Until the end of your next long rest your Sneak Attack damage with that weapon becomes Poison damage and creatures struck with it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier or become Poisoned for one minute. Creatures poisoned this way make a new save at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on success. Once a creature passes the save against this effect, it cannot suffer the Poisoned condition from it again for 24 hours.

If you gain expertise in a skill you already have expertise in, you can instead select another skill or tool you have proficiency in to gain expertise in."
Assassin,Favored Approach,"Starting at 13th level, you hone your skills gaining a favored approach to dealing death. Select one of the following benefits:

    ●  	Trusted Face. If you spend seven days establishing a fake identity for yourself or three hours studying another person to impersonate, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check involving maintaining your disguise and identity.

    ●  	Swift Blade. When you roll initiative while Hidden from all hostile creatures rolling initiative, you gain advantage on the roll.

    ●  	Specialized Poisons. When you create a poison, you can designate one creature type (for example, Fiends). The damage of that poison ignores resistance or immunity that creature type may have to poison or the Poisoned condition."
Assassin,Lethal Blows,"Starting at 17th level, after you deal sneak attack damage to a creature, if the target's remaining hit points is less than your Rogue level, the target dies. You can forgo this when intentionally making nonlethal attacks."
Classes,Sorcerer,"Magic flows through Sorcerers like blood in their veins, manifesting as raw, instinctive power rather than studied technique."
Sorcerer,Class Features,"As a Sorcerer, you gain the following class features."
Class Features,Hit Points,"**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per Sorcerer level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per Sorcerer level after 1st"

Class Features,Spellcasting,"An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells."
Spellcasting,Cantrips,"At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list. You learn additional Sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table."
Spellcasting,Spell Slots,"The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Burning Hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Burning Hands using either slot."
Spellcasting,Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher,"You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more Sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots."
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Ability,"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier"
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Focus,You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Sorcerer spells.
Class Features,Sorcerous Origin,"Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level."

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted."
Metamagic,Careful Spell,"When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell."
Metamagic,Distant Spell,"When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet."
Metamagic,Empowered Spell,"When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell."
Metamagic,Extended Spell,"When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours."

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray aren’t eligible, but Ray of Frost is."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Class Features,Sorcerous Restoration,"At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest."
Sorcerer,Sorcerous Origins,Different Sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic with many variations such as magical ancestry or exposure to mystical energy.
Sorcerous Origins,Draconic Bloodline,"Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, Sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty Sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given Sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance."
Draconic Bloodline,Dragon Ancestor,"Dragon | Damage Type
Black | Acid
Blue | Lightning
Brass | Fire
Bronze | Lightning
Copper | Acid
Gold | Fire
Green | Poison
Red | Fire
Silver | Cold
White | Cold"
Draconic Bloodline,Draconic Resilience,"As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier."
Draconic Bloodline,Elemental Affinity,"Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour."
Draconic Bloodline,Dragon Wings,"At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them."
Draconic Bloodline,Draconic Presence,"Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours."
Sorcerous Origins,Fey Warped,"Your innate magic comes from the touch of the fey. Chaotic and varied, this can be a blessing, curse, or both. How directly this touch has affected your appearance and character can vary from quite a bit to not at all, but it grants powers tied to illusion, enchantment, and twisting reality. It is more common in ancestries that have a clear fey origin, such as elves or fairies, but is known to occur among humans as well.

Though neither illusion nor enchantment is inherently evil, few will be willing to trust Sorcerers who have been obviously touched by such powers. Nonetheless, they can make powerful allies and entertaining companions."
Fey Warped,Fey Warped Features,
Fey Warped,Fey Magic,"You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Fey Origin Spells table. For each level of spells, you can select one of the two spells to learn. You learn the selected spell and it becomes a Sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of Sorcerer spells known."
Fey Warped,Fey Origin Spells,"Sorcerer Level | Spells
1st | Charm Person, Faerie Fire
3rd | Mirror Image, Misty Step
5th | Blink, Hypnotic Pattern
7th | Confusion, Greater Invisibility
9th | Dominate Person, Mislead"
Fey Warped,Fey Trickery,"You learn the Minor Illusion cantrip. It does not count against your cantrips known. Additionally, you are Adept at illusory tricks, gaining the ability to befuddle, trick and baffle people with your magic. As a bonus action, you can do any of the following:

    ●  	Minor Illusions. You can cast Minor Illusion.

    ●  	Obscuring Tricks. Make a creature of your choice (including yourself) within 30 feet invisible or heavily obscured by an illusion until the start of its next turn.

    ●  	Glamorous Presence. Gain advantage on a Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion check, gaining a grander presence through your illusions.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you complete a long rest."
Fey Warped,Dramatic Powers,"Your magic gives you a flair that easily impresses others. You gain proficiency in your choice of persuasion, intimidation, deception, or performance. If you are already proficient in all options, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice."
Fey Warped,Biting Illusions,"Starting at 6th level, once per turn on your turn when you roll damage with an illusion spell, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage roll. Additionally, once per turn when a creature interacts with one of your illusions, you can choose to deal psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier to them (such as destroying a Mirror Image or inspecting a Major Image). If they make a check or save to determine the reality of the illusion that has damaged them that turn, it is made with disadvantage."
Fey Warped,Fey Steps,"Starting at 14th level, when you spend sorcery points to empower a spell with metamagic, before or after you cast the spell, you can teleport up to 5 feet per sorcery point spent."
Fey Warped,Illusory Doppelgangers,"At 18th level, as a bonus action you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself at a point within 30 feet. The duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and if targeted with an effect that forces a save, it uses your saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate or it fails a saving throw that would cause it to take damage the duplicate is destroyed. It ignores all other damage and effects, but an effect that would otherwise cause it to take damage reveals it to be a duplicate. The duplicate mimics your action and is indistinguishable from you until you attack, cast a spell, or take damage. The duplicate looks real even to creatures with blindsight or truesight. When you create the duplicate, you can expend 2 sorcery points to create an additional duplicate, creating up to 3 duplicates.

At the end of each of your turns while a duplicate exists, you can switch places with any active duplicate within 120 feet, leaving no trace of which one is real until you attack, cast a spell, or take damage. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. You can use it again early by expending 2 sorcery points."

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell."
Pact Magic,Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher,"At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more Warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots."
Pact Magic,Spellcasting Ability,"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier"
Pact Magic,Spellcasting Focus,You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Warlock spells.
Class Features,Eldritch Invocations,"In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level."
Class Features,Pact Boon,"At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice."
Pact Boon,Pact of the Chain,"You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction."
Pact Boon,Pact of the Blade,"You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks."
Pact Boon,Pact of the Tome,"Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the Warlock spell list, they are nonetheless Warlock spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Class Features,Mystic Arcanum,"At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the Warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more Warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest."
Class Features,Eldritch Master,"At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again."
Class Features,Eldritch Invocations,"If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class."

Eldritch Invocations,Book of Ancient Secrets,"Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a Warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your Warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it."

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings."

Warlock,Otherworldly Patrons,"The beings that serve as patrons for Warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their Warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect Warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one Warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals."
Otherworldly Patrons,The Fiend,"You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords, archdevils, pit fiends, and balors that are especially mighty, and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths."
The Fiend,Expanded Spell List,"Spell Level | Spells
1st | Burning Hands, Command
2nd | Blindness/Deafness, Scorching Ray
3rd | Fireball, Stinking Cloud
4th | Fire Shield, Wall of Fire
5th | Flame Strike, Hallow"

The Fiend,Dark One’s Own Luck,"Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest."
The Fiend,Fiendish Resilience,"Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance."
The Fiend,Hurl Through Hell,"Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."
Otherworldly Patrons,The Overseer,"You have made a pact with an all seeing being of the outer planes: an infamous creature whose very name is forbidden from being put to text by almighty coastal Wizards, most known for its all-seeing eyes, great paranoia, and reality warping dreams. The nature of your pact may be down to delusion (yours, its, or both), or working toward some greater scheme of such brilliance that lesser minds cannot hope to comprehend."
The Overseer,The Overseer Features,
The Overseer,Overseer Expanded Spells,"Spell Level | Spells
1st | Sleep, Guidance
2nd | Blindness/Deafness, See Invisibility

3 | Slowing Ray | The target’s movement speed is halved until the start of your next turn.
4 | Petrification Ray | The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the slow spell until the start of your next turn.

6 | Disintegration Ray | The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 + your Charisma modifier force damage."
The Overseer,Lingering Gaze,"At 6th level, when you invoke your Overseer’s Gaze, the spectral eye lasts for 1 minute before fading away, and you use your bonus action on each of turns to cause it to fire again, rolling on the table anew. Once during the duration of each eye, you can pick the effect it fires instead of rolling. The spectral eye moves with you and is always in your space.

While you have the spectral eye with you, have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can perform the Search action as a bonus action (instead of firing an eye ray)."
The Overseer,Patron’s Paranoia,"Beginning at 10th level, your patron’s paranoia affects and benefits you with constant vigilance. You can no longer be surprised, benefit from your normal passive perception even while sleeping, and can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls."
The Overseer,Suppressor’s Sight,"Starting at 14th level, you can conjure the full power of your patron’s magic suppressing eye. As an action, you manifest a giant spectral eye in your space which creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) in a 150-foot cone until the start of your next turn. This eye does not move from the space it was manifested in. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."
The Overseer,Additional Invocations,"When you select The Overseer as your otherworldly patron, the following become additional options for your Warlock invocation selections."
The Overseer,Controlled Chaos,"Prerequisite: Overseer patron

When you roll on the Eye Ray Effects table, you can roll twice and choose between the two effects. If you roll the same value on both dice, you can pick any effect from the table."
The Overseer,Overseer’s Sight,"Prerequisite: 15th level, Overseer patron

You gain truesight with a range of 30 feet. This range is doubled while you have a spectral eye manifested from Lingering Gaze."
Otherworldly Patrons,Your Pact Boon,"Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.

**Pact of the Chain.** Your familiar takes on a form reflecting your patron’s nature. If you serve the Fiend, your familiar might manifest as a cunning imp or a fiery quasit. Those bound to the Overseer summon familiars that evoke its omnipresent vigilance—creatures with multiple eyes, strange glowing features, or unnerving whispers, a constant reminder of its watchful gaze.

**Pact of the Blade.** The weapon granted by your pact reflects your patron's essence. For the Fiend, it could be a jagged blade wreathed in flickering flames, forged in the infernal planes. If your patron is the Overseer, your weapon may appear alien and unsettling—a staff or glaive adorned with swirling, eye-like patterns or warped metal that twists unnaturally in the light, its mere presence invoking unease.

**Pact of the Tome.** Your Book of Shadows reflects the nature of your pact. A Fiend’s gift is a charred, iron-bound tome filled with infernal conjurations and dark lore. The Overseer’s tome, by contrast, is a disjointed, disturbing text of shifting glyphs, unplaceable materials, and fragmented visions that alter the mind, imparting forbidden knowledge and glimpses into unknowable truths."
Classes,Wizard,"Through study, discipline, and boundless curiosity, Wizards unravel the secrets of magic, bending reality through sheer knowledge."

Class Features,Spellcasting,"As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power."
Spellcasting,Cantrips,"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. You learn additional Wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table."
Spellcasting,Spellbook,"At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level Wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the Wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind."
Spellcasting,Your Spellbook,"The spells you add to your spellbook reflect your arcane research and intellectual breakthroughs about the multiverse. You might find other spells during adventures, like a scroll in an evil Wizard’s chest or a dusty tome in an ancient library.

**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing its basic form and deciphering its unique notation. Practice until you understand the sounds and gestures, then transcribe it using your notation.

Each level takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. This includes material components and fine inks for experimentation and recording. Once mastered, you can prepare the spell like other spells.

**Replacing the Book.** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many Wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

**The Book’s Appearance.** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap."
Spellcasting,Preparing and Casting Spells,"The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list."
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Ability,"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier"
Spellcasting,Ritual Casting,You can cast a Wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting,Spellcasting Focus,You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Wizard spells.
Spellcasting,Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher,"Each time you gain a Wizard level, you can add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar)."
Class Features,Arcane Recovery,"You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level Wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots."
Class Features,Arcane Tradition,"When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level."
Class Features,Ability Score Improvement,"At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20."
Class Features,Spell Mastery,"At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Wizard spell and a 2nd-level Wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels."
Class Features,Signature Spells,"When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal."
Wizard,Arcane Traditions,"The study of Wizardry, dating back to early magical discoveries, is prevalent in fantasy gaming worlds with diverse magical traditions.

The most common arcane traditions revolve around the eight schools of magic, cataloged by Wizards throughout history: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy and Transmutation. These schools can be literal institutions, like the School of Illusion, or academic departments with rival faculties. Even Wizards who train apprentices use the school division as a learning device, as each school requires mastery of different techniques."
Arcane Traditions,Arcanist,
Arcanist,Scholarly Specialty,"[When you take this archetype at 2nd level, choose one classical school of magic as your Scholarly Specialty: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. The gold and time you must spend to copy spells from this school into your spellbook is halved. If a feature refers to your chosen school, it refers to the school selected in this feature.]"
Arcanist,Esoteric Talent,"Also at 2nd level, you gain one of the following benefits:"
Arcanist,Bend Magic,"[When you cast a wizard spell with an instantaneous duration that deals damage to an area, you can choose a number of creatures in the area that you can locate locate can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one creature). The chosen creatures take no damage from the spell.]"
Arcanist,Flash of Insight,"[You can use a bonus action to roll a d20, record the result, and choose a creature you can locate locate can see within 30 feet. The next time that creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it takes that d20 result instead of rolling. If you use this feature again before you finish a short rest, you must expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to do so.]"
Arcanist,Quick Step,"[After you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you can immediately move up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks or spending any of your normal movement.]"

Instead of gaining these temporary hit points yourself, you can use your reaction to grant them to a creature you can locate locate can see within 30 feet.]"
Arcanist,Energy Retention,"[When you expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, you regain one expended spell slot. The regained spell slot must be of a level no more than half the level of the expended spell slot.]"

War Magic,Precise Understanding,"When you see a creature cast a spell from your chosen school, you automatically know what spell it's casting. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against spells."
Arcane Traditions,Theurge,"Not all wizards focus on one of the traditional 8 schools of magic. Wizards of this pursuit delve what other Wizards consider untouchable. The secrets of the divine. They discover and delve the paths of power that divine magic activates, and seek to recreate it through precise understanding and deep knowledge. Some are deeply religious, devoted to gods and seeking to understand them at a higher level, some follow unrestrained academic curiosity, and yet others seek this power for blasphemous reasons."
Theurge,Theurge Features,
Theurge,Study of the Divine,"Beginning at 2nd level, you delve the secrets of the divine, prying into magic usually denied to the arcane paths. Whenever you gain a Wizard level, you can replace one of the Wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a spell from the Cleric spell list. Any Cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a Wizard spell for you and is recorded in your spellbook, but other Wizards are unable to copy these spells into their own spellbooks. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and can never be a spell level higher than your proficiency bonus (meaning you will be unable to learn Cleric spells of 7th level or higher).

Your ability to recreate divine magic using arcane magic is limited. You can cast a number of spells gained from this feature equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses when you complete a long rest. When you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can choose to reset this limit instead of regain spell slots. Using divine magic that brings creatures back from the dead strains your body, causing you to gain 2 levels of exhaustion when you cast a spell learned through this feature that restores a creature to life."
Theurge,Theologian,"Additionally at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you already have proficiency in Religion, you can select another skill to gain proficiency in."

Theurge,Divine Revelation,"Beginning at 10th level, your understanding of divine magic reaches complete comprehension. You can copy Cleric spells into your spellbook from scrolls or other written records of them. Additionally, when you deal fire or lightning damage, you can replace half the damage dealt with radiant damage. When you deal cold or poison damage, you can replace half the damage dealt with necrotic damage."
Theurge,Divine Synthesis,"Starting at 14th level, your research into the synthesis of divine and arcane reveals to you a greater harmony of power. When you cast a 1st level or higher spell from the Wizard spell list or a spell from the Cleric spell list as your action, you can cast a 1st level or higher spell from the other list with a casting time of an action or bonus action as a bonus action (regardless of its casting time). The total level of the two spells combined cannot exceed your half your Wizard level (rounded down)."

Backgrounds,Acolyte,"You’ve dedicated your life to serving a temple or pantheon of gods, acting as an intermediary between the holy and mortal realms. While not necessarily a Cleric, you perform sacred rites and sacrifices to guide worshipers to the divine.

Choose a deity or pantheon and collaborate with your GM to detail your religious service. Were you a temple functionary raised to assist priests, or a high priest with a unique calling? Perhaps you lead a small cult or an occult group serving a fiendish master you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp"
Acolyte,Feature: Shelter of the Faithful,"As an acolyte, you command respect and perform religious ceremonies. Adventuring companions receive free healing and care at faith-affiliated locations, but must provide spell components.

You may have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your deity or pantheon, where you reside. This could be your former temple if you remain on good terms, or a new home. Near your temple, you can seek assistance from priests, but only for non-hazardous requests and if you maintain good standing."
Acolyte,Suggested Characteristics,"Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme."
Creating a Character,Determine Ability Scores,"Use the following scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Assign each of these numbers to one of your character's six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability."
Determine Ability Scores,Variant: Rolling Scores,"Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest die, and record the total. Repeat 6 times. Assign each of these numbers to one of your character's six abilities. (Alternately, use the scores above but randomly assign them.) Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability."

Creating a Character,Using Ability Scores,"Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:

    ●  	**Strength**, measuring physical power

    ●  	**Dexterity**, measuring agility

    ●  	**Constitution**, measuring endurance

    ●  	**Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory

    ●  	**Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight

    ●  	**Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number."
Using Ability Scores,Ability Scores and Modifiers,"Score | Modifier

2–3 | −4

22–23 | +6
24–25 | +7
26–27 | +8
28–29 | +9
30 | +10"
Using Ability Scores,Advantage and Disadvantage,"When a special ability or spell grants advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, you roll a second d20. Use the higher roll for advantage and the lower roll for disadvantage. For instance, with disadvantage, you use a 5, while with advantage, you use a 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll, granting advantage or imposing disadvantage, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. Even if two favorable situations grant advantage, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you have neither and roll one d20. This applies even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and a game feature, like the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. For example, a halfling with advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolling a 1 and a 13 could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through special abilities, actions, spells, or inspiration. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll and grant advantage or impose disadvantage."
Using Ability Scores,Proficiency Bonus,"Characters and monsters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, which is incorporated into their stat blocks and used in ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules allow you to add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you add it only once when you make the save."
Using Ability Scores,Expertise,"If you have expertise in a skill, you double your proficiency bonus when using that skill.

For example, the Rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

If a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from it, you don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check, your proficiency bonus is 0, given that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply."
Using Ability Scores,Ability Checks,"Task Difficulty | DC
Very easy | 5
Easy | 10
Medium | 15
Hard | 20
Very hard | 25
Nearly impossible | 30"
Ability Checks,Contests,"When characters or monsters oppose each other, a contest determines the outcome. Both make ability checks for their efforts, applying bonuses and penalties. Instead of comparing totals to a DC, they compare their check totals. The participant with the higher total wins. This character succeeds or prevents the other from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains unchanged. One contestant may win by default. For instance, if two characters tie in a contest to grab a ring, neither succeeds. In a contest between a monster and an adventurer, a tie keeps the door shut."
Ability Checks,Skills,"Each ability covers various capabilities, including proficiencies in skills. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and proficiency indicates focus on that aspect. Characters’ starting skill proficiencies are determined at creation, while monsters’ proficiencies appear in their stat blocks.

For instance, a Dexterity check could reflect acrobatics, palming, or hiding. Each aspect has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth. Proficiency in Stealth enhances Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills typically related to each ability score are listed below. See an ability’s description for examples of skill usage."

    ●  	Intimidation

    ●  	Performance

    ●  	Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they just makes a Strength check.

Usually, proficiency applies only to specific ability checks. For instance, Athletics proficiency usually applies to Strength checks. However, in some situations, proficiency might reasonably apply to a different check. In such cases, the GM might ask for an unusual ability and skill combination check, or you might ask to apply proficiency to a different check. For example, if you must swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to assess stamina. In this case, you can apply Athletics proficiency and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check, adding your proficiency bonus as usual. Similarly, when your dwarf Dreadnought uses raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, despite Intimidation being usually associated with Charisma."
Ability Checks,Passive Checks,"A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

**10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check**

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules."
Ability Checks,Working Together,"Characters team up to attempt tasks. The leader or character with the highest ability modifier can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting help. In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only help if they could do the task alone. For example, opening a lock requires thieves’ tools proficiency, so a character without it can’t help. Also, help is only useful when working together would be productive. Some tasks, like threading a needle, are harder with help."
Working Together,Group Checks,"When a group attempts a task, the GM may ask for a group ability check. Skilled characters help cover those who aren’t.

To make a group ability check, all group members make the check. If at least half succeed, the group succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

Group checks are rare and most useful when all characters succeed or fail as a group. For instance, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the GM may call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to avoid hazards. If at least half succeed, they guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, they stumble into hazards."
Using Ability Scores,Using Each Ability,Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.
Using Each Ability,Strength,"Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force."
Strength,Strength Checks,"A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

**Athletics.** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

    ●  	You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.

    ●  	You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.

    ●  	You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

**Other Strength Checks.** The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    ●  	Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door

    ●  	Break free of bonds

    ●  	Push through a tunnel that is too small

    ●  	Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it

    ●  	Tip over a statue

    ●  	Keep a boulder from rolling"
Strength,Attack Rolls and Damage,"You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand* to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack."
Strength,Lifting and Carrying,"Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights."
Strength,Variant: Encumbrance,"The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution."
Using Each Ability,Dexterity,"Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance."
Dexterity,Dexterity Checks,"A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

**Acrobatics.** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

**Sleight of Hand.** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.

**Stealth.** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

**Other Dexterity Checks.** The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    ●  	Securely tie up a prisoner

    ●  	Wriggle free of bonds

    ●  	Craft a small or detailed object

    ●  	Balance a precarious object or stack

    ●  	Catch a falling item

    ●  	Maneuver through a tight or crowded space"
Dexterity,Attack Rolls and Damage,"You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier."
Dexterity,Armor Class,"Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class."
Dexterity,Initiative,"At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat."
Dexterity,Hiding,"The DM decides when hiding is appropriate. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide. Until discovered or stopped hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any actively searching creature.

You can’t hide from clear sight or make noise, which gives away your position. Invisible creatures can hide, but signs of their passage may be noticed, and they must stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for danger. If you approach a creature while hidden, it usually sees you. However, the DM may allow you to stay hidden if the creature is distracted, giving you an advantage on an attack roll before being seen.

**Passive Perception.** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.

**What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in chapter XX, “Adventuring.”"
Using Each Ability,Constitution,"Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force."
Constitution,Constitution Checks,"Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    ●  	Hold your breath

    ●  	March or labor for hours without rest

    ●  	Go without sleep

    ●  	Survive without food or water

    ●  	Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go"
Constitution,Hit Points,"Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7."
Using Each Ability,Intelligence,"Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason."
Intelligence,Intelligence Checks,"An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

**Arcana.** Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

**History.** Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost cultures.

**Investigation.** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

**Nature.** Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

**Religion.** Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

**Other Intelligence Checks.** The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    ●  	Calculate the weight or volume of an object by sight

    ●  	Estimate the value of a precious item

    ●  	Analyze the properties of an unfamiliar material or liquid

    ●  	Forge a document

    ●  	Solve a complex puzzle under pressure

    ●  	Recall a obscure detail from a past encounter"
Intelligence,Spellcasting Ability,"Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast."
Using Each Ability,Wisdom,Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.
Wisdom,Wisdom Checks,"A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

**Animal Handling.** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

**Insight.** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

**Medicine.** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

**Perception.** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

Locate. A creature that can locate locate a target uses one or more of its senses to determine the target’s precise position. Sight-reliant creatures cannot use hearing alone to locate locate a target. Blind creatures (not those with the Blinded condition) can locate locate targets but may need to succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check to pinpoint their exact position, at the GM's discretion. If an effect requires that a target can locate locate you and it isn’t using vision for this, use its passive Wisdom (Perception) to determine whether it locate locates your position.

**Survival.** The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

**Other Wisdom Checks.** The GM might call for a

Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    ●  	Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow

    ●  	Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead"
Wisdom,Spellcasting Ability,"Clerics, Wodewoses, and Rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast."
Using Each Ability,Charisma,"Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality."
Charisma,Charisma Checks,"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

**Deception.** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**Intimidation.** When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

**Performance.** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**Persuasion.** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

**Other Charisma Checks.** The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    ●  	Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip

    ●  	Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation"
Charisma,Spellcasting Ability,"Bards, Vanguards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast."
Using Ability Scores,Saving Throws,"A saving throw, also called a save, represents an attempt to resist threats like spells, traps, poison, or diseases. You don’t usually decide to make one; you’re forced to because your character or monster is at risk.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For instance, use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

Situational bonuses or penalties can modify a saving throw, and advantage and disadvantage can affect it, as determined by the GM.

Each class has proficiency in at least two saving throws. For example, Wizards are proficient in Intelligence saves. Proficiency lets a character add their proficiency bonus to saving throws made with a particular ability score. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies.

The Difficulty Class (DC) for a saving throw depends on the effect. For instance, the DC for a spell’s saving throw is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

A successful or failed saving throw is detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means no or reduced harm from an effect."
Creating a Character,Variant Rule: Disabilities,"Fantasy worlds benefit by reflecting the real world’s diversity in physical and mental abilities. Here are three methods to achieve this:

1. **Narrative.** Describe the situation without mechanical implementation. This is the easiest and preferred method by many who don’t want their complex lived experience reduced to a game mechanic.
2. **Assistive benefits without penalties.** Emphasize assistive devices by adding benefits (bonuses and powers) to characters’ assistive devices while narratively expressing disability traits.
3. **Trait and assistance mechanics.** Each disability trait has a mechanical representation. Some are die roll modifiers, while others have more complex mechanics. Consider the advantages of each trait, such as chronic pain giving a bonus on saving throws against psychic damage or blindness reducing the severity of navigating in darkness. Think about how characters would adapt to living with a disability for a long time and the benefits that would give. Also consider the drawbacks of assistive devices, which don’t erase the disability but may offer advantages like characters in wheelchairs being less likely to fall on ice. Finally, consider adding fantasy benefits to devices like attacks, defenses, or other powers. Limitless Heroics - Including Characters with Disabilities, Mental Illness, and Neurodivergence in Fifth Edition by Wyrmworks Publishing offers comprehensive examples."

Level Advancement,Multiclassing,"Multiclassing lets you gain levels in multiple classes, mixing their abilities to create unique character concepts. You can gain a level in a new class whenever you advance, instead of your current class. Levels in all classes add up to determine your character level. For instance, three Wizard levels and two Fighter levels make you a 5th-level character.

As you level up, you may stay in your original class with a few levels in another, or change course entirely. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you sacrifice focus for versatility."
Multiclassing,Prerequisites,"Class | Ability Score Minimum
Dreadnought | Strength 13
Bard | Charisma 13
Cleric | Wisdom 13
Wodewose | Wisdom 13
Fighter | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13
Adept | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13
Vanguard | Strength 13 and Charisma 13
Ranger | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13
Rogue | Dexterity 13
Sorcerer | Charisma 13
Warlock | Charisma 13
Wizard | Intelligence 13"
Multiclassing,Experience Points,"The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a Cleric 6/Fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric."
Multiclassing,Hit Points and Hit Dice,"You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Vanguard have a d10, so if you are a Vanguard 5/Fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a Vanguard 5/Cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice."
Multiclassing,Proficiency Bonus,"Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter XX, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a Fighter 3/Rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3."
Multiclassing,Proficiencies,"Class | Proficiencies Gained
Dreadnought | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons
Bard | Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice
Cleric | Light armor, medium armor, shields
Wodewose | Light armor, medium armor, shields (Wodewoses will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)
Fighter | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons
Adept | Simple weapons, shortswords
Vanguard | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons
Ranger | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list
Rogue | Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools
Sorcerer | —

Multiclassing,Class Features,"When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting."
Class Features,Channel Divinity,"If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a Cleric 6/Vanguard 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the Cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes."
Class Features,Extra Attack,"If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the Fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the Warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack."
Class Features,Unarmored Defense,"If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class."

Multiclassing,Alignment,"A creature’s alignment in the game world describes its moral and personal attitudes. It’s a combination of morality (good, evil, or neutral) and attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine alignments exist.

These brief descriptions outline the typical behavior of a creature with an alignment. Individuals may vary, and few are consistently faithful to their alignment’s precepts.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust."

Equipment,Selling Treasure,"Opportunities arise to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in dungeons. You can sell your loot in towns or settlements if you find buyers.

Undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost in markets. Monsters’ weapons and armor are rarely in good condition for sale.

Selling magic items is tricky. Potions and scrolls are easy to find buyers for, but other items are rare and expensive, mostly for wealthy nobles. Magic items are far more valuable than gold and should be treated as such.

Gems, jewelry, and art objects retain their full value and can be traded for coin or used as currency. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM may require you to find a buyer in a large town or community.

Trade goods such as grain, salt, and domesticated beasts are sought after everywhere and so are unlikely to diminish much in value from place to place."
Equipment,Armor,"Fantasy gaming worlds have diverse cultures with varying technology levels, offering adventurers a wide range of armor types, from leather to chain mail and costly plate armor. The Armor table categorizes these common armor types into light, medium, and heavy armor, along with their cost, weight, and other properties. Many warriors also use shields.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time."
Armor,Light Armor,"Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Padded.** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

**Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

**Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes."
Armor,Medium Armor,"Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Hide.** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts.

**Chain Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Breastplate.** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

**Half Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps."

Equipment,Weapons,"Your class grants proficiency in weapons reflecting its focus and your likely use. Whether you prefer a longsword or longbow, your weapon and skill can mean life or death in adventuring.

The Weapons table lists common fantasy weapons, their prices, weights, damage, and special properties. Each weapon is classified as **melee** (within 5 feet) or **ranged**."
Weapons,Weapon Proficiency,"Your ancestry, class, and feats grant proficiency with simple or martial weapons. **Simple** weapons, like clubs and maces, are easy to use and suitable for most people. **Martial** weapons, like swords and axes, require specialized training and are preferred by warriors for their effectiveness.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll."
Weapons,Weapon Properties,"Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**Ammunition.** You can use a ranged weapon with ammunition only if you have ammunition. Each attack uses one piece of ammunition. Drawing ammunition from a container is part of the attack. You can recover half your expended ammunition by searching the battlefield at the end of the battle.

If you use a ranged weapon with ammunition for a melee attack, treat it as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal damage.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Heavy.** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**Special.** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack."
Weapon Properties,Improvised Weapons,"Characters without weapons may attack with improvised weapons, such as broken glass, table legs, frying pans, wagon wheels, or dead goblins. Often, improvised weapons resemble actual weapons and can be treated as such. For instance, a table leg is akin to a club. Proficient characters can use similar objects as weapons, utilizing their proficiency bonus. Objects unrelated to weapons deal 1d4 damage (assigned by the GM). Ranged weapons used for melee attacks or thrown melee weapons without the thrown property also deal 1d4 damage. Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet."
Weapon Properties,Silvered Weapons,"Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective."

Equipment,Expenses,"Adventurers face mundane realities beyond exploring ruins, waging war, or delving into the earth’s depths. In a fantastical world, people need shelter, sustenance, and clothing, which cost money, with some lifestyles incurring higher costs."
rule,Adventuring,"Life as an adventurer is full of danger, discovery, and opportunity. Adventurers must rely on skill, strategy, and teamwork to survive and thrive in a world of endless possibilities."
Adventuring,Roleplay,"Roleplay, the core of collaborative storytelling, allows players to embody characters, interact with the world, and influence its course through dialogue, decisions, and relationships. It enhances the narrative beyond combat and exploration by expressing characters’ personalities, motivations, and quirks.

Roleplay offers various opportunities, such as persuasion, deception, empathy, and in-party dynamics. It thrives on creativity and improvisation, enabling players to explore characters and the game world’s emotional and social depth. While dice rolls may not be prevalent, well-timed skill checks add depth, blending game mechanics with storytelling.

Examples include:

    ●  	Spinning a compelling tale and rolling a Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince a guard to let the party enter a restricted area.

    ●  	Bluffing a rival merchant to negotiate a better deal with a Charisma (Deception) check.

    ●  	Roleplaying a character’s reaction to a major failure, like mourning a fallen ally.

    ●  	Navigating court politics to gain favor or sow discord.

    ●  	Convincing a dragon to spare the party by exploiting its vanity or offering an unconventional gift, the gift giving advantage on a Charisma (Persuasion) check."
Adventuring,Exploration,"Exploration is more than just travel; it’s the thrill of the unknown. Adventurers face environmental challenges, solve mysteries, and adapt to changing landscapes."
Exploration,Time,"In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time."
Exploration,Movement,"Swimming, sneaking, scaling—movement plays a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize adventurers’ movement without calculating distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late on the third day.” In dungeons, especially large ones or cave networks, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian, you consult your map, leading you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”

Sometimes, knowing travel time is important, whether in days, hours, or minutes. Travel time depends on two factors: the speed and pace of creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over."
Movement,Speed,"Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day."
Movement,Difficult Terrain,"Adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day."
Movement,Special Types of Movement,"Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go."
Movement,"Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling","While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check."
Movement,Jumping,"Type of Jump | Jump Distance | Conditions | Checks
Long Jump (running) | Up to your Strength score (feet) with a 10-foot running start | Height doesn’t matter unless specified by the GM | DC 10 Strength (Athletics) to clear a low obstacle; DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to avoid falling prone in difficult terrain
Long Jump (standing) | Half your Strength score (feet) | Each foot jumped uses 1 foot of movement | Same as running long jump
High Jump (running) | 3 + Strength modifier (feet) with a 10-foot running start | Extend arms to reach height of the jump plus 1.5 × your height | GM may allow a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than normal
High Jump (standing) | Half the result of a running high jump | Each foot jumped uses 1 foot of movement | Same as running high jump"
Exploration,The Environment,"By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places."
The Environment,Falling,"A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall."
The Environment,Suffocating,"A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points."
The Environment,Vision and Light,"The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.

Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness."
The Environment,Blindsight,"A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense."
The Environment,Darkvision,"Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray."
The Environment,Truesight,"A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane."
The Environment,Food and Water,Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.
The Environment,Food,"A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero."
The Environment,Water,"A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case."
Exploration,Resting,"Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day."
Resting,Short Rest,"A short rest is at least 1 hour of light activity like eating and tending wounds. At the end, a character can spend Hit Dice (up to their level) to regain hit points by rolling each die and adding their Constitution modifier. More Hit Dice can be spent after each roll. Some Hit Dice are regained after a long rest."
Resting,Long Rest,"A long rest is at least 8 hours, including at least 6 hours of sleep or complete rest and no more than 2 hours of light activity (e.g., eating, talking, standing watch).

If a character engages in 1+ hour of strenuous activity (e.g., fighting, spellcasting, marching) before completing 6 hours of rest, they must restart the rest.

Strenuous activity after 6 hours doesn’t invalidate the rest, but each hour of strenuous activity adds 1 additional hour to the total rest time required (up to 12 hours total).

At the end of a long rest, the character regains all HP and half their spent Hit Dice (minimum 1). They must have at least 1 HP and can’t benefit from more than one long rest in 24 hours.

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits."
Adventuring,Combat,"A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other."
Combat,Combat Step by Step,"1. **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
2. **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are locate located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.
3. **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
4. **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
5. **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops."
Combat,Surprise,"A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t."
Combat,Initiative,"Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first."
Combat,Your Turn,"On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”"
Combat,Bonus Actions,"Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a Rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action."
Combat,Other Activity on Your Turn,"Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge."
Combat,Reactions,"Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction."
Combat,Movement and Position,"In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving."
Movement and Position,Breaking Up Your Move,"You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet."
Movement and Position,Moving between Attacks,"If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a Fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again."
Movement and Position,Using Different Speeds,"If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a Wizard cast the Fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more."
Movement and Position,Difficult Terrain,"Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar* choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain."
Movement and Position,Being Prone,"Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend

15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement."
Combat,Interacting with Objects Around You,"Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:

    ●  	draw or sheathe a sword

    ●  	open or close a door

    ●  	withdraw a potion from your backpack

    ●  	pick up a dropped axe

    ●  	take a bauble from a table

    ●  	remove a ring from your finger

    ●  	stuff some food into your mouth

    ●  	plant a banner in the ground

    ●  	fish a few coins from your belt pouch

    ●  	throw a lever or a switch

    ●  	pull a torch from a sconce

    ●  	take a book from a shelf you can reach

    ●  	extinguish a small flame

    ●  	don a mask

    ●  	pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head

    ●  	put your ear to a door

    ●  	kick a small stone

    ●  	turn a key in a lock

    ●  	tap the floor with a 10-foot pole

    ●  	hand an item to another character"
Interacting with Objects Around You,Moving Around Other Creatures,"You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter."
Interacting with Objects Around You,Flying Movement,"Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the Fly spell."
Interacting with Objects Around You,Creature Size,"Size | Space
Tiny | 2½ by 2½ ft.
Small | 5 by 5 ft.
Medium | 5 by 5 ft.
Large | 10 by 10 ft.
Huge | 15 by 15 ft.
Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger"
Interacting with Objects Around You,Space,"A creature’s space is the area it effectively controls in combat, not its physical dimensions. A Medium creature doesn’t have a 5-foot width, but it controls a 5-foot space. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot doorway, other creatures can’t pass unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. This limits the number of creatures that can surround another in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Larger creatures take up more space, so fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for others. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one."
Interacting with Objects Around You,Squeezing into a Smaller Space,"A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for its smaller size. Thus, a Large creature can pass through a 5-foot wide passage. While squeezing, it spends an extra foot for every foot moved and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls have advantage against the creature in the smaller space."
Combat,Actions in Combat,"When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure."
Actions in Combat,Attack,"The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the Fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action."
Actions in Combat,Cast a Spell,"Spellcasters like Wizards and Clerics, as well as many monsters, can use spells effectively in combat. Each spell has a casting time, specifying whether it requires an action, reaction, minutes, or hours. Casting isn’t always an action, but most spells take 1 action, so spellcasters often use their action in combat."
Actions in Combat,Dash,"When you dash, you gain extra movement equal to your speed, after any modifiers. For example, with a 30-foot speed, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn. Any speed change affects this movement by the same amount. If your speed drops to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn."
Actions in Combat,Disengage,"If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn."
Actions in Combat,Dodge,"When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can locate locatecan see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0."
Actions in Combat,Help,"You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage."
Actions in Combat,Hide,"When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter."
Actions in Combat,Ready,"Sometimes, you want to act before your next turn. You can take the Ready action to do so.

First, decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, choose the action you’ll take or move up to your speed. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can take your reaction immediately or ignore it. Remember, you can only take one reaction per round.

To ready a spell, cast it normally but hold its energy. You release the energy with your reaction when the trigger occurs. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and require concentration. If your concentration breaks, the spell dissipates. For example, if you’re concentrating on Web spell and ready Magic Missile, your Web spell ends if you take damage before releasing Magic Missile."
Actions in Combat,Search,"When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check."
Actions in Combat,Use an Object,"You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn."
Combat,Making an Attack,"Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s **Range:** a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack."
Making an Attack,Attack Rolls,"When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block."
Making an Attack,Modifiers to the Roll,"When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**Ability Modifier** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

**Proficiency Bonus** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell."
Making an Attack,Rolling 1 or 20,"Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

A critical hit occurs when the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, regardless of modifiers or the target’s AC.

A miss occurs when the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, regardless of modifiers or the target’s AC."
Making an Attack,Unseen Attackers and Targets,"Combatants often avoid detection by hiding, turning invisible, or staying in darkness.

If you attack a target you can’t locate, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This applies whether you’re guessing the target’s position or can hear it but not see it. If the target isn’t where you aimed, the attack automatically misses, but the GM typically just says the attack missed.

When a creature can’t locate you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden, both unseen and unheard, you reveal your location when you make an attack, hit or miss.

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the Invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

When a creature can’t locate locate see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses."
Making an Attack,Ranged Attacks,"When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack."
Making an Attack,Range,"You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range."
Making an Attack,Ranged Attacks in Close Combat,"Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated."
Making an Attack,Melee Attacks,"Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes."
Making an Attack,Opportunity Attacks,"In a fight, you can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature you can locate locate see moves out of your reach. Use your reaction to make a melee attack against it before it leaves your reach.

To avoid opportunity attacks, take the Disengage action, teleport, or let someone or something move you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, an explosion hurling you out of a foe’s reach or gravity causing you to fall past an enemy don’t provoke an opportunity attack."
Making an Attack,Two-Weapon Fighting,"When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it."
Making an Attack,Grappling,"When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Escaping a Grapple** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

**Moving a Grappled Creature** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you."
Making an Attack,Contests in Combat,Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.
Making an Attack,Shoving a Creature,"Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you."
Combat,Cover,"Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle."
Combat,Damage and Healing,"Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a Fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures."
Damage and Healing,Hit Points,"Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points."
Damage and Healing,Damage Rolls,"Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a Wizard casts Fireball or a Cleric casts Flame Strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast."
Damage and Healing,Critical Hits,"When you score a critical hit, roll the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Add any relevant modifiers. To speed up play, roll all damage dice at once.

For example, with a dagger, roll 2d4 for damage instead of 1d4. If the attack involves other damage dice, roll them twice."
Damage and Healing,Damage Types,"Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**Acid** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**Bludgeoning** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**Cold** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**Fire** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**Force** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including Magic Missile and spiritual weapon.

**Lightning** A Lightning Bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**Necrotic** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as Chill Touch, withers matter and even the soul.

**Piercing** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**Poison** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**Psychic** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**Radiant** Radiant damage, dealt by a Cleric’s Flame Strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**Slashing** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**Thunder** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the Thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage."
Damage and Healing,Damage Resistance and Vulnerability,"Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and vulnerability apply after other damage modifiers. For instance, a creature has bludgeoning resistance and takes 25 bludgeoning damage. A magical aura reduces all damage by 5, so the 25 is reduced to 10. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability for the same damage type count as one. For example, a creature has bludgeoning and nonmagical damage resistance, so nonmagical fire damage is reduced by half, not three-quarters."
Damage and Healing,Healing,"Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a Cure Wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a Wodewose grants a Ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the Ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the Ranger regains 6 hit points from the Wodewose, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the Revivify spell has restored it to life."
Damage and Healing,Dropping to 0 Hit Points,"When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections."
Damage and Healing,Instant Death,"Massive damage can injure or kill you instantly. If you are reduced to 0 hit points after taking an amount of damage equal to or greater than 20 + triple your character level (or Hit Dice for creatures), you make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you die instantly. On a success, you live but suffer one level of exhaustion."
Damage and Healing,Falling Unconscious,"If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points."
Damage and Healing,Death Saving Throws,"Whenever starting with 0 hit points, make a death saving throw to determine your fate. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an ability score. You rely on spells and features to improve your chances of success.

Roll a d20. A 10 or higher result is success, while a lower result is failure. These outcomes don’t affect you directly. On your third success, you become stable. On your third failure, you die. Keep track of both successes and failures until you have three of a kind. Reset the count to zero when you regain hit points or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**Damage at 0 Hit Points** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death."
Damage and Healing,Stabilizing a Creature,"To save a creature with 0 hit points, heal it. If healing is unavailable, stabilize it to prevent a failed death saving throw.

Use your action to administer first aid and attempt stabilization. This requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws but remains unconscious. It regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours if not healed."
Damage and Healing,Monsters and Death,"Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters."
Damage and Healing,Knocking a Creature Out,"Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable."
Damage and Healing,Temporary Hit Points,"Temporary hit points are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect against injury. They are separate from your actual hit points and can exceed them.

When taking damage, temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, with 5 temporary hit points and 7 damage, you lose 5 and take 2.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. You decide whether to keep or gain temporary hit points when receiving more. For instance, with 10 temporary hit points and a spell granting 12, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

Receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore consciousness or stabilize you when you have 0 hit points. They can absorb damage, but only true healing saves you.

Temporary hit points last until depleted or after a long rest unless a feature has a duration."
Combat,Mounted Combat,"A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a Wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a Cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules."
Mounted Combat,Mounting and Dismounting,"Mounting or dismounting a creature within 5 feet costs half your speed in movement. For instance, at 30 feet speed, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. You can’t mount if you lack movement or have 0 speed.

If an effect moves your mount against your will, succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing prone within 5 feet. If knocked prone while mounted, make the same saving throw.

If knocked prone, use your reaction to dismount as it falls, landing on your feet. Otherwise, fall prone within 5 feet of the mount."
Mounted Combat,Controlling a Mount,"While mounted, you have two options: control the mount or let it act independently. Intelligent creatures like dragons act independently.

You can control a mount only if it’s trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, etc. are assumed to be trained. The controlled mount’s initiative matches yours, and it moves and acts as you direct. It has three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act on your turn.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. It can take any action without restrictions and moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee, rush to attack, or act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount."
rule,Spellcasting,"Magic rules fantasy gaming worlds, often as spells. This section covers spellcasting. Character classes and monsters have unique spell learning and preparation methods. Regardless of origin, spells follow these rules.

**What Is a Spell?**

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of magical energies in the multiverse. Casting a spell involves plucking, pinning, vibrating, and releasing invisible strands of magic to unleash the desired effect, usually in seconds. Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards, dealing damage, undoing it, imposing or removing conditions, draining life energy, or restoring it. Thousands of spells have been created throughout history, many forgotten. Some might be recorded in ancient spellbooks or trapped in the minds of dead gods, while others could be reinvented by powerful characters.

**Spell Level**

Spells have levels from 0 to 9, indicating their power. Magic missile is 1st level, while Wish is 9th. Cantrips are simple but powerful spells cast almost by rote, level 0. Higher level spells require higher character level. Spell level and character level don’t directly correspond. A character usually needs to be at least 17th level, not 9th, to cast a 9th-level spell.

**Known and Prepared Spells**

Before using a spell, a spellcaster must mentally fix it or access it in a magic item. Some classes, like Bards and Sorcerers, have a limited list of fixed spells. Many magic-using monsters also have fixed spells. Other spellcasters, like Clerics and Wizards, prepare spells, which varies by class. The number of fixed spells a caster can have depends on their level.

**Spell Slots**

Regardless of spell knowledge, casters can cast a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating magic is physically and mentally taxing, especially for higher-level spells. Each spellcasting class’s description includes a table showing spell slots of each level a character can use at each level. For instance, the 3rd-level Wizard Umara has four 1st-level and two 2nd-level slots.

When casting a spell, a character expends a slot of that level or higher, effectively filling it. A spell slot is a groove of a specific size, with 1st-level slots being the smallest and 9th-level slots being the largest. So, when Umara casts Magic Missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one slot and has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores expended spell slots. Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast spells without using spell slots, such as Warlocks choosing certain eldritch invocations and pit fiends from the Nine Hells.

**Casting a Spell at a Higher Level**

When a spellcaster casts a spell with a higher-level slot, the spell assumes that level. For example, if Umara casts Magic Missile with a 2nd-level slot, it’s 2nd level. Some spells, like Magic Missile and Cure Wounds, have more powerful effects at higher levels, as detailed in the spell’s description.

**Casting in Armor**

Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

**Cantrips**

A cantrip is a spell cast at will without using a spell slot or preparation. Repeated practice fixes the spell in the caster’s mind and infuses them with the magic needed to produce the effect repeatedly. Cantrips have a spell level of 0.

**Rituals**

Certain spells have a “ritual” tag. Casting a ritual spell follows normal spellcasting rules, but it takes 10 minutes longer and doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a ritual spell, a spellcaster must have a feature granting this ability, such as Clerics or Wodewoses. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on their spell list, unless specified otherwise by their ritual feature, like Wizards.

**Casting a Spell**

When a character casts a spell, the same basic rules apply, regardless of class or spell effects. Each spell description includes name, level, school, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest details the spell’s effect.

**Casting Time**

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

**Bonus Action**

A spell cast with a bonus action is swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn, unless you’ve already taken one this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a 1-action casting time.

**Reactions**

Some spells can be cast as reactions, taking a fraction of a second to bring about in response to an event. The spell description specifies when this is possible.

**Longer Casting Times**

Certain spells, including ritual spells, require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When casting a spell with a longer casting time than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell and maintain your concentration. If your concentration breaks, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. To try again, start over.

**Range**

The target of a spell must be within its range. For example, Magic Missile targets a creature, while Fireball targets the point of fire’s eruption.

Spell ranges are usually expressed in feet. Some spells target only a creature you touch, while others affect only you (self range). Spells that create cones or lines of effect from you also have self range.

Once cast, spell effects aren’t limited by their range unless the spell description says otherwise.

**Components**

A spell’s components are the physical requirements to cast it. Each spell description specifies if it needs verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you lack one or more components, you can’t cast the spell.

**Verbal (V)**

Most spells require chanting mystical words. The combination of sounds, pitch, and resonance sets magic in motion, not the words themselves. A gagged character or one in a silent area can’t cast verbal spells. Spellcasters with verbal disabilities may adapt their spells to use grunts, whistles, hums, or noisy body movements like claps or stomps.

**Somatic (S)**

Spellcasting gestures can be forceful or intricate. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must use at least one free hand. A spellcaster with a hand-related disability may adapt spells’ somatic components to a different limb or other body movements.

**Material (M)**

Casting spells requires specific objects, indicated in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus instead. However, if a component has a cost, the character must possess it before casting. If a spell consumes a material component, the caster must provide it for each casting. A spellcaster must have a free hand to access material components or hold a spellcasting focus, but it can be the same hand used for somatic components.

**Duration**

A spell’s duration is its persistence time, expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify their effects last until dispelled or destroyed.

**Instantaneous**

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

**Concentration**

Some spells require concentration to maintain their magic. If you lose concentration, the spell ends. If a spell needs concentration, its Duration entry specifies how long you can concentrate. You can end concentration anytime. Normal activity doesn’t interfere. The following can break concentration:

* **Casting another spell that requires concentration. **You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while concentrating on a spell, make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. The DC is 10 or half the damage, whichever is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, make a separate saving throw for each.
* **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if incapacitated or die. The GM may also require a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell due to certain environmental phenomena, like a crashing wave on a storm-tossed ship.

**Targets**

A spell typically targets one or more creatures, objects, or an area of effect’s origin. Unless a spell has a noticeable effect, a creature might not know it was targeted. For instance, crackling lightning is obvious, but subtle effects like reading a creature’s thoughts go unnoticed unless the spell states otherwise.

**A Clear Path to the Target**

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t locate locate see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

**Targeting Yourself**

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless it must be hostile or a creature other than you. If you’re in the spell’s area of effect, you can target yourself.

**Areas of Effect**

Spells like Burning Hands and Cone of Cold cover an area, affecting multiple creatures. The spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which can be a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Each shape has a point of origin, from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules specify how to position the point of origin. It’s usually a point in space, but some spells have a creature or object as the origin. The effect expands in straight lines from the origin. If no unblocked line extends to the area, that location isn’t included. To block one of these lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

**Cone**

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length. A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

**Cube**

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

**Cylinder**

A cylinder’s origin is the center of a circle of a specific radius, as per the spell description. The circle must be on the ground or at the spell’s effect height. Energy expands in straight lines from the origin to the circle’s perimeter, forming the cylinder’s base. The spell’s effect shoots up or down from the base or top to the cylinder’s height. The point of origin is included in the area of effect.

**Line**

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

**Sphere**

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

**Saving Throws**

Many spells allow targets to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of their effects. The spell specifies the ability used for the save and the outcome of a success or failure.

The DC to resist a spell equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

**Attack Rolls**

Some spells require an attack roll to determine if the spell effect hits the target. Your spell attack bonus equals your spellcasting ability modifier plus your proficiency bonus. Most spell attack rolls involve ranged attacks. You have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you’re within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can locate locate see you and isn’t incapacitated.

**The Schools of Magic**

Academies of magic group spells into eight schools of magic, believing that all magic functions similarly, regardless of its source. Scholars, especially Wizards, apply these categories to all spells.

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

**Abjuration** spells protect, some with aggressive uses. They create barriers, negate harm, harm trespassers, or banish creatures.

**Conjuration** spells transport objects and creatures. Some summon or teleport, while others create objects.

**Divination** spells reveal secrets, futures, hidden locations, illusions’ truths, or distant visions.

**Enchantment** spells affect minds, influencing behavior. They can make enemies friends, force actions, or control creatures.

**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy, producing desired effects like fire or lightning blasts or healing.

**Illusion** spells deceive senses or minds, causing phantom sights, sounds, or memories. Some create phantom images, while others plant images directly in minds.

**Necromancy** spells manipulate life and death energies. They grant life force reserves, drain life, create undead, or resurrect the dead. Creating undead through Animate Dead is evil and rarely used.

**Transmutation** spells change properties, turning enemies into harmless creatures, bolstering allies, making objects move at will, or enhancing healing.

**Combining Magical Effects**

The effects of different spells combine while their durations overlap. However, the most potent effect from multiple castings applies while their durations overlap. For instance, if two Clerics cast Bless on the same target, the character gains the spell’s benefit only once, not twice."

**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube.

You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

**Aquatic Adaptation. **You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**Change Appearance. **You transform your appearance.

You can make yourself appear as a member of another ancestry, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

**Natural Weapons. **You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (red ribbon)

**Duration:** 24 hours

Saving Throw: Wisdom negates

Until the spell ends or one of your companions harms it, a beast that you can locate locate see that is able to hear you and has Intelligence 3 or less is charmed by you. If you know a sign language, you can prepare the spell to affect a creature that can see you instead.

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (tightly rolled strip of paper)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You whisper a message of 25 words or less to a tiny beast, along with directions to a location you have visited and a brief description of the message’s recipient.

For the duration of the spell, the messenger travels towards the location at a rate of 50 miles per day for a messenger with a flying speed, or else 25 miles without.

Cast at Higher Levels. The duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd."
Spell Descriptions,Animal Shapes,"8th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (24 hours)

Any number of willing creatures you can locate locate see transforms into a Large or smaller beast of your choice with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. Each target may have the same or a different form than other targets.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform targets into new forms, gaining new hit points when they do so.

Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target’s game statistics (including its hit points) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast excepting its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form.

When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effect on the target ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points."
Spell Descriptions,Animate Dead,"3rd-level necromancy

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (two copper coins)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You animate a mortal’s remains to become your undead servant.

If the spell is cast upon bones you create a skeleton, and if cast upon a corpse you can choose to create a skeleton or a zombie. The GM has the undead’s statistics.

While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command any undead you created with this spell. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the creature’s exact action and move, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area, which it follows until the task is complete or you issue it a new command. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself.

The undead is under your control for 24 hours unless you cast this spell on it before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 4 of your previously-animated undead instead of animating a new one. When no longer under your control, the undead no longer obeys your commands.

**At Higher Levels.** You create or maintain control over 2 additional undead for each slot level above 3rd."

Spell Descriptions,Antilife Shell,"5th-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Area:** 10-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

A translucent barrier pops into existence around you. The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its surface.

The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.

The spell ends if you move so that a living creature is forced to pass through the barrier."
Spell Descriptions,Antimagic Field,"8th-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Area:** 10-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of powdered cold iron)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

An invisible sphere of antimagic forms around you, moving with you and suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator’s discretion, sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the sphere’s effects.

*Area Suppression:* When a magical effect protrudes into the sphere, that part of the effect’s area is suppressed.

*Creatures and Objects:* While within the sphere, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily ceases to exist while the space they occupy is within the sphere.

*Dispel Magic:* The sphere is immune to D*ispel Magic* and similar magical effects, including other *Antimagic Field* spells.

*Magic Items:* While within the sphere, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the sphere.

*Magical Travel:* Whether the sphere includes a destination or source, any planar travel or teleportation within it fails. Until the spell ends or the sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a *bag of holding*) within the sphere are closed.

*Spells:* Any spell cast within the sphere or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the sphere. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed counts against it."
Spell Descriptions,Antipathy/Sympathy,"8th-level enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Target:** Huge or smaller object, creature,

or 200-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (flask of honey and vinegar)

**Duration:** 10 days

Designate a species or heritage of intelligent creature, such as dragons. The target now causes either antipathy or sympathy for the specified creatures for the duration of the spell. A creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect the first time it sees or comes within 60 feet of the target, every 24 hours thereafter, and whenever it ends its turn neither within 60 feet nor within sight of the target. When a designated creature successfully saves against the effects of the spell, it immediately understands it was under a magical effect and is immune to this spell’s effects for 1 minute.

*Antipathy:* When a designated creature can locate locate see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened on a failure. While frightened the creature must use its movement to move away from the target until it can no longer locate locate see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can no longer locate locate see it, it is no longer frightened until it can locate locate see the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

*Sympathy:* When a designated creature can locate locate see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature uses its movement on each of its turns to move into the area or within reach of the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect."
Spell Descriptions,Arcane Eye,"4th-level divination

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a mushroom-shaped piece

of wood inside a universal joint)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

You create an invisible, floating magical eye through which you can see. The eye has normal vision, darkvision to a range of 30 feet, and it can look in every direction.

You can use an action to move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction as long as it remains on the same plane of existence. The eye can pass through openings as small as 1 inch across but otherwise its movement is blocked by solid barriers."
Spell Descriptions,Arcane Hand,"5th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large, translucent hand made of force in an unoccupied space you can see.

The hand doesn’t fill its space and has AC 20, Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 10 (+0), maneuver DC 18, and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. The spell ends early if it is dropped to 0 hit points.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then choose one of the following.

*Shove:* The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the hand pushes the creature in a direction of your choosing for up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to 5 times your spellcasting ability modifier, and remains within 5 feet of it.

*Smash:* Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of the hand. On a hit, the hand deals 4d8 force damage.

*Snatch:* The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the creature is grappled by the hand. You can use a bonus action to crush a creature grappled by the hand, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

*Stop:* Until the hand is given another command it moves to stay between you and a creature of your choice, granting you three-quarters cover against the chosen creature. A creature with a Strength score of 26 or less cannot move through the hand’s space, and stronger creatures treat the hand as difficult terrain.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage from Smash increases by 2d8 and the damage from Snatch increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th."
Spell Descriptions,Arcane Lock,"2nd-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration: **Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting Knock on the object suppresses Arcane Lock for 10 minutes. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10."
Spell Descriptions,Arcane Sword,"7th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon an insubstantial yet deadly sword to do your bidding.

Make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword, dealing 3d10 force damage on a hit.

You can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a space you can see and make an identical melee spell attack against a target."
Spell Descriptions,Arcanist’s Magic Aura,"2nd-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (a small square of silk)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You craft an illusion to deceive others about the target’s true magical properties.

Choose one or both of the following effects. When cast upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts until it is dispelled.

*False Aura:* A magical target appears nonmagical, a nonmagical target appears magical, or you change a target’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic of your choosing. Additionally, you can choose to make a nonmagical item seem magical to any creature that handles the item.

*Masking Effect:* Choose a creature type. Spells and magical effects that detect creature types treat the target as if it were a creature of that type. Additionally, you can choose to mask the target’s alignment trait (if it has one).

**At Higher Levels.** When cast using a 6th-level spell slot or higher the effects last until dispelled or dismissed with a bonus action."
Spell Descriptions,Astral Projection,"9th-level necromancy

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range: **10 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Special

Until the spell ends, the targets leave their material bodies (unconscious, not aging or requiring food or air) and project nearly identical forms into the Astral Plane. These astral forms use the targets’ game statistics and possessions.

While in astral form the targets each trail a tether, a silvery-white cord that fades into immateriality a foot behind them. As long as the tether is not destroyed, a target can find their way back to their material body. If it is cut—which requires an effect specifically stating that it cuts your tether—the target immediately dies. Otherwise, damage and other effects on a target’s astral form have no effect on their material body either during this spell or after its duration ends. An astral form can travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through interplanar portals on the Astral Plane leading to any other plane. When a target leaves the Astral Plane, their material body and possessions are transported along the tether, allowing them to return fully intact to their body, with all their gear, as they enter the new plane.

The spell ends for all targets when you use an action to dismiss it, for an individual target when a successful *Dispel Magic* is cast upon its astral form or material body, or when either its material body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points. When the spell ends for a target and the tether is intact, the tether pulls the target’s astral form back to its material body, ending the suspended animation.

If the spell ends for you early, other targets are stranded in their astral forms until they drop to 0 hit points or leave the plane."
Spell Descriptions,Augury,"2nd-level divination (ritual)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components: **V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)

**Duration: **Instantaneous

With the aid of a divining tool, you receive an omen about the success or failure of a course of action that you plan to embark upon within the next 30 minutes. The Narrator chooses from the following:

* Fortunate omen (good results)
* Calamity omen (bad results)
* Ambivalence omen (both good and bad results)
* No omen (results that aren’t especially good or bad)

This omen does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases. The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%."
Spell Descriptions,Awaken,"5th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You impart sentience in the target, granting it an Intelligence of 10 and proficiency in a language you know. A plant targeted by this spell gains the ability to move, as well as senses identical to those of a human. The GM assigns awakened plant statistics.

The target is charmed by you for 30 days. The charmed condition ends early if you or your companions harm the target. Depending on how you treated the target while it was charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature may choose to remain friendly to you.

**At Higher Levels.** Target an additional creature for each slot level above 5th. Each target requires its own material component."
Spell Descriptions,Bane,"1st-level enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a drop of blood)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

The senses of the targets are filled with phantom energies that make them more vulnerable and less capable. Until the spell ends, a d4 is subtracted from attack rolls and saving throws made by a target.

**At Higher Levels.** You target an additional creature for each slot level above 1st."
Spell Descriptions,Banishment,"4th-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target is banished to a featureless demiplane (or its native plane, if it is not native to this plane) and incapacitated. At the end of this banishment, the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space).

At the end of each of its turns, a banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a –1 penalty for each round it has spent banished, ending the banishment on a success. The banishment also ends if the spell ends early. If the spell is maintained for its maximum duration, a target native to this plane ends the banishment, while a target native to a different plane doesn’t return.

**At Higher Levels.** The duration of banishment on a native creature increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th."
Spell Descriptions,Barkskin,"2nd-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

The target’s skin takes on the texture and appearance of bark, increasing its AC to 16 (unless its AC is already higher).

**At Higher Levels.** The target’s AC increases by +1 for every two slot levels above 2nd."
Spell Descriptions,Beacon of Hope,"3rd-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, each target makes Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws with advantage, and when a target receives healing it regains the maximum number of hit points possible."
Spell Descriptions,Bestow Curse,"3rd-level necromancy

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one of the following:

        •      	The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws using an ability score of your choice.

        •      	The target makes attack rolls against you with disadvantage.

        •      	Each turn, the target loses its action unless it succeeds a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn.

        •      	Your attacks and spells deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage against the target.

A curse lasts until the spell ends. At the GM’s discretion you may create a different curse effect with this spell so long as it is weaker than the options above.

A *Remove Curse* spell ends the effect if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or greater than the spell slot used to cast *Bestow Curse*.

**At Higher Levels.** When using a 4th-level spell slot the duration increases to 10 minutes. When using a 5th-level spell slot the duration increases to 8 hours and it no longer requires your concentration. When using a 7th-level spell slot the duration is 24 hours."
Spell Descriptions,Black Tentacles,"4th-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **90 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

Writhing black tentacles fill the ground within the area, turning it into difficult terrain. When a creature starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn, it takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained by the tentacles unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A restrained creature can use its action to make an Acrobatics or Athletics check against the spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 slot levels above 4th."
Spell Descriptions,Blade Barrier,"6th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of slashing blades. The wall can be up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick, and can either be a straight wall up to 100 feet long or a ringed wall of up to 60 feet in diameter. The wall provides three-quarters cover and its area is difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the wall’s area or enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn, it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th."
Spell Descriptions,Bless,"1st-level enchantment

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Instantaneous

Necrotic energies deal 8d8 necrotic damage to the target. Undead and constructs are immune to this spell.

You reanimate the targets as undead and transform them into ghouls under your control. This spell cannot be cast in sunlight.

While it is within 120 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.

The undead is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any commands. You must cast this spell on the undead before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 3 undead you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

**At Higher Levels.** You create or reassert control over one additional ghoul for each slot level above 6th. Alternatively, when using an 8th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 2 ghasts or wights, or when using a 9th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 3 ghasts or wights, or 2 mummies. When commanding more than 3 undead they make group attack rolls (see Combat)."

If the creature has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak, it’s unaffected. Learn its surface thoughts. As an action, shift attention or probe deeper. Probing requires a Wisdom saving throw. Failure grants insight into reasoning, emotional state, and a significant thought. The target knows you’re probing and can contest your Intelligence check with an Intelligence check to end the spell.

You assert control over one beast’s mind and it is charmed for the duration. If it is engaged in combat with you or creatures friendly to you, it has advantage on its saving throw.

No action is required to issue commands, which can be a simple and general course of action such as “Attack that target,” “Go over there,” or “Bring me that object.” Without commands the target only defends itself. The target continues to follow a command until its task is complete.

You can use your action to assume direct control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, you decide all of the target’s actions and movements. While a target is directly controlled in this way, you can also cause it to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

You can choose to let the messenger terrorize the target. The messenger can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you have a portion of the target’s body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the messenger’s fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents it from benefiting from the rest. In addition, upon waking the target suffers a level of exhaustion, up to a maximum of 3.

Creatures that don’t sleep or don’t dream (such as elves) cannot be targeted by this spell."

At the GM’s discretion, this spell may have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area.

***Fissures:*** At the start of your next turn after you cast the spell, roll 1d6. This number of 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide fissures bisect the area at your choice of locations. A creature standing on a fissure makes a Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failure and moving to the edge of the fissure on a success.

A structure automatically collapses if a fissure opens beneath it (see below).

***Structures:*** A structure in contact with the ground in the spell’s area takes 50 bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is active. A structure reduced to 0 hit points this way collapses.

Creatures within half the distance of a collapsing structure’s height must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 bludgeoning damage, be knocked prone, and be buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check as an action to escape. A creature inside (instead of near) a collapsing structure has disadvantage on its saving throw. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower depending on the composition of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried."

size decreases one size category. Its size is halved in all dimensions and its weight decreases to one-eighth of its normal value. The target has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws and its weapons shrink, dealing 1d4 less damage (its attacks deal a minimum of 1 damage).

***Asleep:*** The target falls unconscious, waking if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to rouse it.

Your familiar, a spirit that takes the form of any CR 0 beast of Small or Tiny size, appears in an unoccupied space within range. It has the statistics of the chosen form, but is your choice of a celestial, fey, or fiend (instead of a beast).

Your familiar is an independent creature that rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn in combat (but cannot take the Attack action). However, it is loyal to you and always obeys your commands.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes without a trace. Casting the spell again causes it to reappear.

You are able to communicate telepathically with your familiar when it is within 100 feet. As long as it is within this range, you can use an action to see through your familiar’s eyes and hear through its ears until the beginning of your next turn, gaining the benefit of any of its special senses. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings.

You can use an action to either permanently dismiss your familiar or temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

You can’t have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can cause it to adopt a different form.

When you cast a spell with a range of Touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster. Your familiar must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, use your attack bonus for the spell."

You summon a spirit that takes the form of a loyal mount, creating a lasting bond with it. You decide on the steed’s appearance, and choose whether it uses the statistics of an elk, giant lizard, panther, warhorse, or wolf (the GM may offer additional options.) Its statistics change in the following ways:

        •      	Its type is your choice of celestial, fey, or fiend.

        •      	Its size is your choice of Medium or Large.

        •      	Its Intelligence is 6.

        •      	You can communicate with it telepathically while it’s within 1 mile.

        •      	It understands one language that you speak.

While mounted on your steed, when you cast a spell that targets only yourself, you may also target the steed.

When you use an action to dismiss the steed, or when it drops to 0 hit points, it temporarily disappears. Casting this spell again resummons the steed, fully healed and with all conditions removed. You can’t summon a different steed unless you spend an action to release your current steed from its bond, permanently dismissing it.

**At Higher Levels. **The steed has an additional 20 hit points for each slot level above 2nd. When using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you may grant the steed either a swim speed or fly speed equal to its base Speed."

For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

You trace a glyph on one object or a surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends.

The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don’t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.

When you cast the spell, choose Explosive Runes or Spell Glyph.

***Explosive Runes:*** When triggered, the glyph explodes. Creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice when you cast the spell), or half damage on a successful save. The explosion spreads around corners.

***Spell Glyph:*** You store a spell of 3rd-level or lower as part of creating the glyph, expending its spell slot. The stored spell must target a single creature or area with a non-beneficial effect and it is cast when the glyph is triggered. A spell that targets a creature targets the triggering creature. A spell with an area is centered on the targeting creature. A creation or conjuration spell affects an area next to that creature, and targets it with any harmful effects. Spells requiring concentration last for their full duration.

**At Higher Levels. **The cost of the material component increases by 200 gold for each slot level above 3rd. For Explosive Runes, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd, and for Spell Glyph you can store a spell of up to the same level as the spell slot used to cast glyph of warding."

Spell Descriptions,Mage Hand,"Conjuration cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **1 minute

A faintly shimmering phantasmal hand appears at a point you choose within range. It remains until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 30 feet from it.

Spell Descriptions,Magic Circle,"3rd-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range: **10 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

Magical energies surround the area and stop celestials, elementals, fey, fiends or undead (designate one) from willingly entering by nonmagical means.

Creatures of the designated type have disadvantage when attacking creatures within the area and are unable to charm, frighten, or possess creatures within the area. When a designated creature attempts to teleport or use interplanar travel to enter the area, it makes a Charisma saving throw or its attempt fails.

You may also choose to invert this spell, trapping a creature of your chosen type within the area and prevent it from acting outside of said area

**At Higher Levels. **The spell’s duration increases by 1 hour for every slot level above 3rd."
Spell Descriptions,Magic Jar,"6th-level necromancy

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components: **V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration: **Until dispelled

Your body becomes unconscious and incapable of being roused, while your soul enters the vessel used as a material component.

Souls within the jar are aware of their surroundings as though they occupied that space.

While your soul is within the jar, you can, as an action, project your soul to a target within range, either returning it to your body or attempting to possess a humanoid creature. You can take no other actions. You may not target creatures protected by *protection from good and evil* or *magic circle* spells. A creature you try to possess makes a Charisma saving throw or your soul moves from your vessel and into its body. The creature’s soul is now ensnared within the container. On a successful save, the creature resists and you may not attempt to possess it for 24 hours.

Upon possessing a creature, you gain control of it. Replace your game statistics with the creature’s, except your Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom scores. Your own cultural traits and class features also remain, and you may not use the creature’s cultural traits or class features (if it has any).

During possession, you may use an action to return to the vessel if it is within range, returning the host creature to its body. If the host body dies while you are possessing it, the creature also dies and you must make a Charisma save against the spellcasting DC of the spell when it was cast. On a success you return to the container if it’s within range. Otherwise, you die.

If the vessel is destroyed, the spell ends and your soul returns to your body if it’s within range. If your body is out of range or dead when you try to return, you die.

Souls in the jar other than those of the caster cannot take actions or movement. If the vessel is destroyed while occupied by a creature other than yourself, the creature returns to its body if the body is alive and within range. Otherwise, the creature dies.

The vessel is destroyed when the spell ends."

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Duration: **Until dispelled

One unattended object is imbued with a spoken message of 25 words or fewer which it speaks when a trigger condition you choose is met. The message may take up to 10 minutes to convey.

When your trigger condition is met, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in the same voice and volume as you used when instructing it. If the object chosen has a mouth (for example, a painted portrait) this is where the mouth appears.

You may choose upon casting whether the message is a single event, or whether it repeats every time the trigger condition is met.

The trigger condition must be based upon audio or visual cues within 30 feet of the object, and may be highly detailed or as broad as you choose. For example, the trigger could be when any attack action is made within range, or when the first spring shoot breaks ground within range."

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range: **300 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure an extradimensional residence within range. It has one glittering entrance that is in a space of your choosing, and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any designated creatures may enter your mansion while the portal is open. You may open and close the portal while you are within 30 feet of it. Once closed the entrance is invisible. The mansion:

        •          Has an opulent entrance hall.

        •

        •          Has a floorplan you chose, made up of fifty or fewer contiguous 10-foot cubes. All furniture and decor are chosen by you

        •

        •          Contains enough Supply for 5 x your proficiency bonus creatures

A staff of translucent, lustrous servants dwell within, obeying your comments without question and capable of performing the same nonhostile actions as a human servant, though they cannot leave the mansion.

All objects and furnishings belonging to the mansion evaporate into shimmering smoke when they leave it. Any creature within the mansion when the spell ends is expelled into an unoccupied space near the entrance."
Spell Descriptions,Major Image,"3rd-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image in the area that appears completely real. The illusion includes sounds, smells, and temperature in addition to visual phenomena. None of the sensory effects of the illusion are able to cause harm.

While within range you can use an action to move the illusion elsewhere within range. As the image moves you may also change its appearance to make the movement seem natural (like a roc moving its wings to fly) and also change the nonvisual elements of the illusion for the same reason (like the sound of beating wings as the roc flies).

Any physical interaction allows a creature to recognize the image is an illusion. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion. When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.

**At Higher Levels. **When cast using a 6th-level spell slot the illusion lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration."

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components: **V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)

**Duration:** 24 hours

Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. Suggest an activity phrased in a sentence or two. Up to twelve creatures that can perceive and understand you are magically influenced to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable. Asking the targets to perform an action that is obviously harmful to them ends the spell.

A target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can for the duration of the spell or until the target has carried out the activity.

You may specify trigger conditions that cause a target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.

Any damage done to a target by you or an ally ends the spell for that creature.

**At Higher Levels. **When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration of the spell increases to 10 days. When cast using an 8th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 30 days. When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration increases to a year and a day."

**Range: **60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can locate locate see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space."
Spell Descriptions,Meld into Stone,"3rd-level transmutation (ritual)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends, you meld yourself and your carried equipment into a stone object or surface large enough to contain your body. Using your movement, you may enter the stone from any point you can touch. No trace of your presence is visible or detectable by nonmagical senses.

Within the stone, you can’t see outside it and have disadvantage on Perception checks made to hear beyond it. You are aware of time passing, and may cast spells upon yourself. You may use your movement only to step out of the target where you entered it, ending the spell.

If the target is damaged such that its shape changes and you no longer fit within it, you are expelled and take 6d6 bludgeoning damage. Complete destruction of the target, or its transmutation into another substance, expels you and you take 50 bludgeoning damage. When expelled you fall prone into the closest unoccupied space near your entrance point.

**At Higher Levels. **When using a 5th-level spell slot, you may reach out of the target to make spell attacks or ranged weapon attacks without ending the spell. You make these attacks with disadvantage."

**Components: **V, S, M (two lodestones)

**Duration: **Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object."
Spell Descriptions,Message,"Transmutation cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)

**Duration:** 1 round

You point and whisper your message at one creature. It alone hears the message and may reply in a whisper audible only to you.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and are certain it is beyond the barrier. The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

The spell moves freely around corners or through openings."
Spell Descriptions,Meteor Swarm,"9th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

Spell Descriptions,Mind Blank,"8th-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **24 hours

One willing creature is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would read its emotions or thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.

Spell Descriptions,Minor Illusion,"Illusion cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** 1 minute

This spell creates a sound or image of an object. The illusion disappears if dismissed or you cast the spell again.

You may create any sound you choose, ranging in volume from a whisper to a scream. You may choose one sound for the duration or change them at varying points before the spell ends. Sounds are audible outside the spell’s area.

Visual illusions may replicate any image and remain within the spell’s area, but cannot create sound, light, smell, or other sensory effects.

The image is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction as physical objects and creatures pass through it. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion. When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature."
Spell Descriptions,Mirage Arcane,"7th-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **10 days

You make terrain within the spell’s area appear as another kind of terrain, tricking all senses (including touch). The general shape of the terrain remains the same, however.

Structures may be altered, or added where there are none. Creatures are not disguised, concealed, or added by the spell.

The illusion can be physically interacted with. Clear terrain can become difficult terrain, and vice versa. Any part of the illusory terrain such as a boulder, or water collected from an illusory stream, disappears immediately upon leaving the spell’s area.

Creatures with truesight see through the illusion, but are not immune to its effects. They may know that the overgrown path is in fact a well-maintained road, but are still impeded by illusory rocks and branches."
Spell Descriptions,Mirror Image,"2nd-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **1 minute

A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear, sharing your space. These copies move with you and mimic your behavior, creating confusion as to which is real. You can use an action to dismiss them.

Each time you’re targeted by a creature’s attack, roll a d20 to see whetherif it targets you or a copy.

With 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.

A copy’s AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed. It may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. All other damage and effects have no impact.

Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels. **When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to concentration (1 hour)."
Spell Descriptions,Mislead,"5th-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become invisible. Simultaneously, an illusory copy of you appears where you’re standing. This invisibility ends when you cast a spell but the copy lasts until the spell ends.

You can use an action to move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or behave however you’d like.

You may see and hear through your copy. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to swap from seeing through your copy’s senses or your own, and vice versa. While using your copy’s senses you are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings.

The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it."
Spell Descriptions,Misty Step,"2nd-level conjuration

**Casting Time: **1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see, disappearing and reappearing in a swirl of shimmering mist."
Spell Descriptions,Modify Memory,"5th-level enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target has advantage on its saving throw if you are in combat with it. The target becomes charmed and incapacitated, though it can still hear you. Until the spell ends, any memories of an event that took place within the last 24 hours and lasted 10 minutes or less may be altered.

Altering memories must adhere to the following parameters:

        •          You may destroy the memory, have the target recall the event with perfect clarity, change specific details, or create a new memory that matches the timeframe and length. The target fills in gaps in details.

        •          You must speak to the target in a language you both know to modify its memories and describe how the memory is changed

        •          The memory must be logical and plausible to the creature or they are able to simply dismiss it as an obviously faulty memory

        •          Modified memories will not necessarily change a creature’s behavior, especially if conflicts with the creature’s personality, beliefs, etc

The spell automatically ends if the target takes any damage or if it is targeted by another spell. If the spell ends before you have finished modifying its memories, the alteration fails. Otherwise, the alteration is complete when the spell ends and only *greater restoration* or *remove curse* can restore the memory.

There may be events that are unforgettable and utterly fundamental to a creature’s existence. After such memories are modified, they can be remembered correctly when another creature succeeds on a Persuasion check to stir the target’s memories. This check is made with disadvantage if the creature does not have indisputable proof on hand that is relevant to the altered memory.

**At Higher Levels. **When using a 6th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 7 days ago. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 30 days ago. When using an 8th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 1 year ago. When using a 9th-level spell slot, any event can be altered."
Spell Descriptions,Moonbeam,"2nd-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (several seeds of any moon seed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spell’s light.

On your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels. **The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd."
Spell Descriptions,Move Earth,"6th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 2 hours

You reshape the area, changing its elevation or creating and eliminating holes, walls, and pillars. The only limitation is that the elevation change may not exceed half the area’s horizontal dimensions. For example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to include 20-foot-high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain elevation of 20 feet or less. Changes that result in unstable terrain are subject to collapse.

Changes take 10 minutes to complete, after which you can choose another area to affect. Due to the slow speed of transformation, it is nearly impossible for creatures to be hurt or captured by the spell.

This spell has no effect on stone, objects crafted from stone, or plants, though these objects will shift based on changes in the area."
Spell Descriptions,Nondetection,"3rd-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components: **V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce) **Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage."
Spell Descriptions,Passwall,"5th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)

**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, you create a passage extending into a plaster, stone, or wooden surface. When creating the passage you define its dimensions, as long as they do not exceed 5 feet in width, 8 feet in height, or 20 feet in depth. The appearance of the passage has no effect on the stability of the surrounding environment.

Any creatures or objects within the passage when the spell ends are expelled without harm into unoccupied spaces near where the spell was cast."
Spell Descriptions,Phantasmal Killer,"4th-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an illusion that invokes one creature’s deepest fears. Only the target can see this illusion. When the spell is cast and at the end of each of its turns, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw or takes 4d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened. The spell ends early when the target succeeds on its saving throw. A target that succeeds on its initial saving throw takes half damage.

**At Higher Levels. **The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th."
Spell Descriptions,Phantom Steed,"3rd-level illusion (ritual)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range: **30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create an illusory Large creature with an appearance determined by you that comes into being with all the necessary equipment needed to use it as a mount. This equipment vanishes when more than 10 feet away from the creature.

You or any creature you allow may ride the steed, which uses the statistics for a riding horse but has a Speed of 100 feet and travels at 10 miles per hour at a steady pace (13 miles per hour at a fast pace).

The steed vanishes if it takes damage (disappearing instantly) or you use an action to dismiss it (fading away, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount)."
Spell Descriptions,Planar Ally,"6th-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range: **60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You summon a powerful entity, such as a god, primordial, demon prince, or other cosmic being, to aid you. It sends a loyal creature to appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know the creature’s name, you can request it when casting the spell, though the GM may choose a different creature. The creature’s behavior is optional, and you can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment. The task can range from simple to complex, and communication is required for bargaining. Payment can take various forms, such as gold, magic items, living sacrifices, or treasure. A task measured in minutes requires 100 gp per minute, in hours 1,000 gp per hour, and in days (up to 10 days) 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on circumstances. If the task aligns with the creature’s ethos, payment may be halved or waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require half the suggested payment, while dangerous tasks may require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept suicidal tasks. After completing the task or the agreed-upon duration, the creature returns to its home plane, reporting back if appropriate. If payment cannot be agreed upon, the creature returns immediately.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded."
Spell Descriptions,Planar Binding,"5th-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range: **60 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration: **24 hours

One celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend must remain within range for the entire casting of the spell (usually by means of a *magic circle* spell). Until the spell ends, you force the target to serve you. If the target was summoned through some other means, like a spell, the duration of the original spell is extended to match this spell’s duration.

Once it is bound to you the target serves as best it can and follows your orders, but only to the letter of the instruction. A hostile or malevolent target actively seeks to take any advantage of errant phrasing to suit its nature. When a target completes a task you’ve assigned to it, if you are on the same plane of existence the target travels back to you to report it has done so. Otherwise, it returns to where it was bound and remains there until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels. **When using a 6th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 10 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 30 days. When using an 8th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 180 days. When using a 9th-level spell slot, its duration increases to a year and a day."

**Duration: **Instantaneous

One creature, or you and up to 8 willing creatures linking hands in a circle are transported to a plane of existence that you choose. If the destination is generally described, targets arrive near that destination in a location chosen by the GM. If you know the correct sequence of an existing teleportation circle (see *teleportation circle*), you can choose it as the destination (when the designated circle is too small for all targets to fit, any additional targets are shunted to the closest unoccupied spaces).

Alternatively this spell can be used offensively to banish an unwilling target. You make a melee spell attack and on a hit the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a random location on a plane of existence that you choose. Once the target is transported, you must spend 1 minute concentrating on this spell or the target returns to the last space it occupied (otherwise it must find its own way back)."
Spell Descriptions,Plant Growth,"3rd-level transmutation

**Casting Time: **1 action or 8 hours

**Range: **150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You channel vitality into vegetation to achieve one of the following effects, chosen when casting the spell.

**Enlarged:** Plants in the area are greatly enriched. Any harvests of the affected plants provide twice as much food as normal.

**Rapid:** All nonmagical plants in the area surge with the power of life. A creature that moves through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size from being affected."

Spell Descriptions,Polymorph,"4th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

The body of one creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger is transformed into a beast with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn’t have a Challenge Rating, use its level.

Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target’s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells. The target’s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form.

When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.

Spell Descriptions,Prismatic Wall,"9th-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **10 minutes

You create a nontransparent barrier of prismatic energy that sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you choose at the time of casting are immune to the barrier’s effects and may pass through it at will.

The barrier can be created as either a vertical wall or a sphere. If the wall intersects a space occupied by a creature the spell fails, you lose your action, and the spell slot is wasted.

When a creature that can see the barrier moves within 20 feet of the area or starts its turn within 20 feet of the area, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

The wall has 7 layers, each layer of a different color in order from red to violet. Once a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration of the spell. To pass or reach through the barrier a creature does so one layer at a time and must make a Dexterity saving throw for each layer or be subjected to that layer’s effects. On a successful save, any damage taken from a layer is reduced by half.

A *Rod of Cancellation* can destroy a *Prismatic Wall*, but an *Antimagic Field* has no effect.

***Red:*** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage. While active, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t penetrate the barrier. The layer is destroyed by 25 cold damage.

***Orange:*** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage. While active, magical ranged attacks can’t penetrate the barrier. The layer is destroyed by strong winds.

***Yellow:*** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage. This layer is destroyed by 60 force damage.

***Green:*** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage. A *passwall* spell, or any spell of equal or greater level which can create a portal on a solid surface, destroys the layer.

***Blue:*** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage. This layer is destroyed by 25 fire damage.

***Indigo:*** The creature is restrained and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once it accumulates three failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates three successful saves the effect ends. This layer can be destroyed by bright light, such as that created by the *daylight* spell or a spell of equal or greater level.

***Violet:*** The creature is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the creature is banished to another random plane and is no longer blind. If it originated from another plane it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane. This layer can be destroyed by *Dispel Magic* or a similar spell of equal or greater level capable of ending spells or magical effects."

A creature can use an action to attempt an Investigation check against your spell save DC to reveal the spell’s illusory nature.

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You return one creature that died within the last 10 days to life, provided its soul is willing and able to return to its body. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. The spell cannot return an undead creature to life.

The spell cures any poisons and nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time of death. It does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or other magical effects; these must be removed prior to the spell being cast, otherwise they immediately take effect when the creature returns to life.

The spell does not regrow limbs or organs, and it automatically fails if the target is missing any body parts necessary for life (like its heart or head).

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died.

It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws."

Until the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit points, your statistics (except your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores) are replaced by those of the chosen creature. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies as well as gaining the creature’s, keeping the higher of the two if you share one in common.

**Components: **V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an illusory visual image of a creature, object, or other visible effect within a 15-foot cube. The illusion cannot produce sound or smell, and items and other creatures pass through it.

As an action, you can move the image to any point within range. The image’s movement can be natural and lifelike.

A creature that touches the image recognizes it as an illusion. A creature can also spend an action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to determine if the image is an illusion. On a success, it is able to see through the image."
Spell Descriptions,Simulacrum,"7th-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 12 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)

**Duration: **Until dispelled

You sculpt an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time from ice and snow. The duplicate looks exactly like the target and uses all the statistics of the original, though it is formed without any gear, and has only half of the target’s hit point maximum. The duplicate is a creature and can take actions. If the target is able to cast spells, the duplicate cannot cast spells of 7th-level or higher.

The duplicate is friendly to you and your allies. It follows your orders, and moves and acts on your turn in combat. It is a static creature and it does not learn, age, or grow, so it never increases in levels and cannot regain any spent spell slots.

When the simulacrum is damaged you can repair it in an alchemy lab using components worth 100 gold per hit point it regains. When reduced to 0 hit points the simulacrum crumbles into snow and melts away immediately. The simulacrum is also destroyed if you cast this spell again."
Spell Descriptions,Sleep,"1st-level enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **90 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)

**Duration: **1 minute

You put 4d10 hit points worth of creatures into a deep enchanted sleep. Starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets within the area fall unconscious in ascending order according to their hit points. Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends, they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake them.

As each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target. A target’s hit points must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect.

Constructs and undead are not affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels. **The spell affects an additional 2d10 hit points worth of creatures for each slot level above 1st."
Spell Descriptions,Sleet Storm,"3rd-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **150 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a storm of freezing rain and sleet in a 40-foot radius cylinder that is 20 feet high. The ground in the area is covered with slippery ice that makes it difficult terrain, exposed flames in the area are extinguished, and the area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on a turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration."
Spell Descriptions,Slow,"3rd-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a drop of molasses)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted. A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it."
Spell Descriptions,Spare the Dying,"Necromancy cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action

Spell Descriptions,Speak with Animals,"1st-level divination (ritual)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **10 minutes

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion."
Spell Descriptions,Speak with Dead,"3rd-level necromancy

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **10 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (burning incense)

**Duration: **10 minutes

You call forth one corpe’s memories, animating it enough to answer 5 questions. The corpse’s knowledge is limited: it knows only what it knew in life and cannot learn new information or speak about anything that has occurred since its death. It speaks only in the languages it knew, and doesn’t need to give a truthful answer if it has reason not to. Answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

This spell does not return a departed soul, nor does it have any effect on an undead corpse, or one without a mouth."
Spell Descriptions,Speak with Plants,"3rd-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **Self (30-foot radius)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **10 minutes

Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening plants in a 30-foot radius to limited sentience. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations.

The targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain into difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation into ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an *entangle* spell.

At the GM’s discretion the targets may be able to perform other tasks, though each must remain rooted in place. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it but it is not compelled to follow your requests."

**Components: **V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause sharp spikes and thorns to sprout in a 20-foot radius, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters or moves within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

Your magic causes the ground to look natural. A creature that can’t see the area when the spell is cast can spot the hazardous terrain just before entering it by making a Perception check against your spell save DC."

You create a levitating, incandescent weapon with an appearance of your choosing and use it to attack your enemies. On the round you cast it, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon that deals force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and make another attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Components: **V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round."
Spell Descriptions,Stone Shape,"4th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)

You reshape one stone object of Medium size or smaller, or a 5-foot section of stone into any form you choose. For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or chest, make a small passage through a walls less than 5 feet thick, seal a stone door shut, or create a hiding place. The target can have up to two hinges and a latch, but more complex mechanics aren’t possible.

Spell Descriptions,Storm of Vengeance,"9th-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a storm cloud that covers a 360-foot radius area that is up to 5,000 feet in the air. As it forms, lightning and thunder mix with howling winds, and each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage and become deafened for 5 minutes.

Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects:

**Round 2.** Acid rain falls throughout the area dealing 1d6 acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud.

**Round 3.** Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one bolt per creature or object). A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.

**Round 4.** Heavy hail falls throughout the area dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud.

**Round 5–10.** Freezing rain and roiling winds turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud. When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration. Gusts of strong winds between 20–50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical). Finally, each creature beneath the cloud takes 1d6 cold damage."

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 8 hours

Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. Suggest an activity phrased in one to two sentences. One creature is magically influenced to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable. Asking the target to perform an action that is obviously harmful to it ends the spell.

The target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can until it completes the activity or the spell ends.

You may specify trigger conditions that cause the target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.

Any damage done to the target by you or one of your allies ends the spell for that creature.

**At Higher Levels. **When using a 4th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours. When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 7 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year. When using a 9th-level spell slot, the suggestion lasts until it is dispelled. Any use of a 5th-level or higher spell slot grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration."

A mote of brilliant radiance lingers on your hand until the spell ends, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

**Components: **V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration: **Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a potent glyph on one object or a surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter, setting a magical trap for your enemies. If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends. Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don’t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.

When triggered, the glyph sheds dim light in a 60-foot radius for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature within the sphere’s area is targeted by the glyph, as are creatures that enter the sphere for the first time on a turn.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following effects.

**Death:** Creatures in the area make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

**Discord:** Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bicker and squabble with other creatures for 1 minute. While bickering, a creature cannot meaningfully communicate and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**Confused:** Creatures in the area must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become confused for 1 minute.

**Fear:** Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, a creature drops anything it is holding and must try to move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns.

**Hopelessness:** Creatures in the area must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be filled with despair for 1 minute. While despairing, a creature can’t attack or target any creature with harmful effects.

**Pain:** Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated for 1 minute.

**Sleep:** Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. A sleeping creature awakens if it takes damage or an action is used to wake it.

Spell Descriptions,Telekinesis,"5th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You move one Huge or smaller creature or object with the power of your mind. Until the spell ends you can use an action on subsequent turns to pick a new target or continue to affect the same target. Depending on whether you target a creature or an object, the spell has the following effects:

**Creature:** The target makes a Strength check against your spell save DC or it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond the range of the spell.

**Object:** You move the target 30 feet in any direction. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the target fails, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell.

You can use *telekinesis* to finely manipulate objects as though you were using them yourself—you can open doors and unscrew lids, dip a quill in ink and make it write, and so on.

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range: **10 feet

**Components: **V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 round

You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world. The portal remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly travels to the destination circle.

Permanent teleportation circles are commonly found within royal palaces, major centers of commerce, and other important locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence.

When you cast *teleportation circle*, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study.

Casting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence. You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination."

A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures.

Spell Descriptions,True Polymorph,"9th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

One unattended nonmagical object or one creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger is transformed until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends. You can make the transformation permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration.

**Creature into Creature:** The target’s body is transformed into a creature with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn’t have a Challenge Rating, use its level.

The target’s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells, though its personality remains unchanged. If the target is changed into a creature with an alignment trait, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it gains that alignment trait for the duration of the spell. Otherwise, it keeps its own alignment trait.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form.

When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

**Object into Creature:** The target is transformed into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size isn’t larger than the object’s size and it has a Challenge Rating of 9 or less. The creature is friendly to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns, but only . you dictate its actions and movement. However, the GM resolves the creature’s actions and movement and has its statistics.

If the spell becomes permanent, your control over the creature ends. At this point its attitude towards you is determined by how you treated it previously.

**Creature into Object:** You turn the target and whatever it is wearing and carrying into an object. The target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen object and it retains no memory of this time. When the spell ends it reverts to its previous form."

If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points. This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.

You can use a bonus action to mentally command it to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending surfaces and objects, serving a meal, doing laundry, and the like. Once given a command the servant performs the task to completion, then waits for its next command.

**At Higher Levels. **You create an additional servant for each slot level above 1st."
Spell Descriptions,Vampiric Touch,"3rd-level necromancy

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

On the round you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns until it ends, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you deal 3d6 necrotic damage and regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

**At Higher Levels. **The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd."
Spell Descriptions,Vicious Mockery,"Enchantment cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You verbally insult or mock one creature so viciously its mind is seared. As long as the target hears you (understanding your words is not required) it takes 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6)."
Spell Descriptions,Wall of Fire,"4th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long (it does not have to be a straight line; sections of the wall can angle as long as they are contiguous), 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall blocks sight.

When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall (chosen when the spell is cast) deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature also takes that damage when it enters the wall itself for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side deals no damage.

**At Higher Levels. **The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th."
Spell Descriptions,Wall of Force,"5th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall."
Spell Descriptions,Wall of Ice,"6th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1 foot thick.

If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of it (your choice). In addition, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

The wall is an object with vulnerability to fire damage, AC 12, and 30 hit points per 10-foot section. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels. **The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th."
Spell Descriptions,Wall of Stone,"5th-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a small block of granite)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause a nonmagical wall of solid stone to appear at a point you choose. The wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot sections that are only 3 inches thick.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation but must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenelations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object, and each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and at the GM’s discretion might cause connected panels to collapse.

You can make the wall permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration."
Spell Descriptions,Wall of Thorns,"6th-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a handful of thorns)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of thorny vines and brush that blocks line of sight on a solid surface. You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.

When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, but at a cost. It must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves through the wall. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 7d8 slashing damage, or half as much on a successful save.

**At Higher Levels. **Damage dealt by the wall increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th."
Spell Descriptions,Warding Bond,"2nd-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components: **V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action."
Spell Descriptions,Water Breathing,"3rd-level transmutation (ritual)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)

**Duration:** 24 hours

Spell Descriptions,Water Walk,"3rd-level transmutation (ritual)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a piece of cork)

**Duration: **1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can locate locate see within range gain this ability for the duration. If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round."
Spell Descriptions,Web,"2nd-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour

Thick, sticky webs fill a 20-foot cube, lightly obscuring it and making it difficult terrain.

You must anchor the webs between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface. If you don’t, the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell ends. Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).

A creature restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.

Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire."
Spell Descriptions,Weird,"9th-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **Concentration, up to one minute

You plague creatures with nighmares. Each creature in a 30-foot sphere makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened until the spell ends. At the end of each of a frightened creature’s turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature."
Spell Descriptions,Wind Walk,"6th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range: **30 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (fire and holy water)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to 10 willing creatures you can locate locate see assume a gaseous form and appear as wisps of cloud. Each target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, but the only actions it can take the Dash action or to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute during which it is incapacitated and can’t move).

Until the spell ends, a target can change again to cloud form (in an identical transformation process).

When the effect ends for a target flying in cloud form, it descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it safely lands. If the target can’t land after 1 minute, it falls the rest of the way normally."
Spell Descriptions,Wind Wall,"3rd-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **120 feet

**Components: **V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)

**Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of strong wind at a point you choose. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall keeps fog, smoke, and other gasses (including creatures in gaseous form) at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the area fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss (larger projectiles such as boulders and ballista bolts are unaffected).

**At Higher Levels. **The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd."
Spell Descriptions,Wish,"9th-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You alter reality itself.

The safest use of this spell is the duplication of any other spell of 8th-level or lower without needing to meet its requirements (including components).

You may instead choose one of the following:

        •          One nonmagical object of your choice that is worth up to 25,000 gold and no more than 300 feet in any dimension appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.

        •          Up to 20 creatures that you can locate locate see to regain all their hit points, and each is further healed as per the *greater restoration* spell.

        •          Up to 10 creatures that you can locate locate see gain resistance to a damage type you choose.

        •          Up to 10 creatures you can locate locate see gain immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.

        •          You force a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). At your discretion, the roll is made with advantage or disadvantage. You can choose to take either the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible, being very careful in your wording. Be aware that the greater the *wish*, the greater the chance for an unexpected result. This spell might simply fizzle, your desired outcome might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the *wish*. The GM has the final authority in ruling what occurs—and reality is not tampered with lightly.

*Multiple Wishes:* The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. Until finishing a long rest, each time you cast a spell you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented. In addition, your Strength drops to 3 for 2d4 days (if it isn’t 3 or lower already). For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33% chance that you are unable to cast *Wish* ever again."
Spell Descriptions,Word of Recall,"6th-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **5 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration: **Instantaneous

You and up to 5 willing creatures instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary.

Before using the spell in this way, you must first designate a sanctuary by it within a location aligned with your faith, such as a temple of your deity"
Spell Descriptions,Zone of Truth,"2nd-level enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range: **60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration: **10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth."
rule,Conditions,"Conditions temporarily alter a creature’s capabilities, arising from spells, class features, monster attacks, or other effects. Most impairments, like blinded, but some advantages, like invisible, exist.

Conditions last until countered or specified duration. Multiple effects impose the same condition, each with its duration, but effects don’t worsen. A creature has a condition or not.

These definitions specify what happens to a creature under a condition."
Conditions,Blinded,"Note: This condition is not the same as being blind, the permanent disability, as most of the disadvantage is due to a sudden change without time to adapt to it. Blind creatures are more accustomed to using their other senses, and blindness has a spectrum of experiences.

* A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage."
Conditions,Bloodied (Variant Rule),* A creature is bloodied when reduced to half of its maximum hit points or less.
Conditions,Charmed,"* A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
* The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature."
Conditions,Deafened,"Note: This condition is not the same as being deaf, the permanent disability, as most of the disadvantage is due to a sudden change without time to adapt to it. Deaf creatures are more accustomed to using their other senses.

* A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing."
Conditions,Exhaustion,"Level | Effect
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks
2 | Speed halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 | Hit point maximum halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | Death"
Conditions,Frightened,"* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
* The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear."
Conditions,Grappled,"* A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the Thunderwave spell."
Conditions,Incapacitated,* An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.
Conditions,Invisible,"* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage."
Conditions,Paralyzed,"Note: This condition is not the same as paralysis, the permanent disability, as paralysis has a spectrum of experiences, and people with this disability learn to adapt in creative ways to accomplish their goals.

* A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature."

* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature has resistance to all damage.
* The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized."
Conditions,Poisoned,* A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Conditions,Prone,"* A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
* An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage."
Conditions,Restrained,"* A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws."
Conditions,Stunned,"* A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.

rule,Appendix: Cross-System Character Conversion,"This section provides step-by-step guidelines to convert characters between Free5e and Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition (A5E), Tales of the Valiant (ToV), and the 2024 Player’s Handbook (2024 D&D) while maintaining balance and playability. Use these conversion rules for seamless adaptation across systems."
Appendix: Cross-System Character Conversion,Between 2024 D&D and Free5e,"* **Species/Ancestry:** Keep ancestral ability score bonuses flexible. If converting to Free5e, add a Heritage that fits the character’s background.
* **Backgrounds and Cultures:** Assign a feat based on the character’s concept if moving to 2024. Swap the feat for a Culture that provides equivalent benefits if moving to Free5e.
* **Classes and Mastery:** Grant proficiency in an extra weapon type or allow a Fighting Style as a minor boost if converting a class with Mastery to Free5e.
* **Level-Based Class Adjustments:** Some class features shift levels between editions. Features tend to be more frequent in 2024 D&D, with adjustments at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 9th, and 13th levels. Free5e features follow the original 5e pattern but with class name changes.
* **Conversion:**
    * If a feature appears earlier in Free5e, delay its use until reaching that level in 2024.
    * If a feature is missing in Free5e, substitute an equivalent feature from another subclass or use an ASI."
Appendix: Cross-System Character Conversion,Between Free5e and Advanced 5E (A5E),"* **Ancestry and Heritage:** Free5e uses Ancestry (biological traits) and Heritage (cultural traits). A5E uses Heritage (biological traits) and Culture (social traits). When converting to A5E, treat Ancestry as Heritage and choose an appropriate Culture. When converting to Free5e, keep Heritage as Ancestry and assign an appropriate Heritage.
* **Backgrounds and Feats:** Free5e backgrounds provide proficiencies but no feats. A5E backgrounds grant skills, proficiencies, and a feat at 1st level. When converting to A5E, select a feat that aligns with the background. When converting to Free5e, remove the feat and keep only skill and tool proficiencies.
* **Classes and Level Adjustments:** A5E class features are spread across odd-numbered levels, sometimes altering progression. Free5e class progression follows the original 5e pattern. When converting to A5E, delay the use of an A5E feature that appears earlier than in Free5e. If a Free5e feature is missing in A5E, substitute a subclass ability or ASI.
* **Combat & Maneuvers:** A5E introduces Combat Maneuvers and a Maneuver Save DC for martial classes. Free5e does not include maneuvers as a core mechanic.
    * **Conversion:** For A5E, add maneuvers from a Combat Tradition based on the character’s fighting style. For Free5e, remove maneuvers and grant proficiency in an extra weapon or Fighting Style.
* **Spellcasting and Magic Rules: **A5E introduces prayers, rituals, and wyrd magic alongside spellcasting. Free5e uses standard 5e spellcasting.
    * **Conversion:** If a spell doesn’t exist in the target system, replace it with a thematically similar spell. Adjust spell lists to match A5E’s Arcane, Divine, or Primordial classifications when converting to A5E."
Appendix: Cross-System Character Conversion,Between Free5e and Tales of the Valiant (ToV),"* **Ancestry, Heritage, and Lineage:** Free5e uses Ancestry (biological traits) and Heritage (cultural traits). ToV uses Lineage (biological traits) and Heritage (social traits).
    * **Conversion:** When moving to ToV, treat Ancestry as Lineage and choose an appropriate Heritage. When converting to Free5e, keep Lineage as Ancestry and assign a Heritage reflecting the character’s background.
* **Backgrounds and Talents:** Free5e: Backgrounds provide two skill proficiencies and two tool or language proficiencies. ToV: Backgrounds grant skills, proficiencies, and a Talent (similar to a feat) at 1st level.
    * **Conversion:** When moving to ToV, select a Talent that fits the character’s concept. When moving to Free5e, remove the Talent but retain skill and tool proficiencies.
* **Classes and Level Adjustments:** Classes differ slightly, and some names change (e.g., Dreadnought → Berserker). Free5e follows the original 5e class progression.
    * **Conversion:** Delay ToV features appearing earlier than Free5e until the correct level. Replace missing Free5e features with equivalent subclass abilities or ASIs.
* **Combat & Weapon Properties:** ToV introduces expanded weapon properties and rebalanced martial abilities. Free5e uses standard 5e properties.
    * **Conversion:** Apply relevant ToV weapon properties when converting to ToV. Remove ToV-specific properties and adjust combat styles when converting to Free5e.
* **Spellcasting and Magic Rules:** ToV uses spell circles and categorizes magic into Arcane, Divine, Primordial, and Wyrd sources. Free5e uses standard 5e spellcasting and progression.
    * **Conversion:** Adjust spell selections to align with ToV’s magic source system when converting to ToV. Use the closest equivalent spells and follow standard spell slot progression when converting to Free5e."
