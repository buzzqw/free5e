## What is Free5e?

Free5e is a fully open, community-built alternative to 5e tabletop roleplaying rules. Itâ€™s designed to be:

* **Fully free** to use, share, modify, and publish under Creative Commons BY 4.0.
* **Accessible and inclusive**, with disability representation, mixed ancestries and cultures, and alternative formats.
* **System-compatible** with other 5e variants, with conversion tools for 2014/2024 5e, Tales of the Valiant, and Level Up: Advanced 5e.
* **Modular and expandable**, with player-facing and GM tools that allow for broad customizations without breaking balance.

Use this repo to contribute, build tools, translate, or develop your own projects using Free5e.
