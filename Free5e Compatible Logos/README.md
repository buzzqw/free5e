## Creating your own compatibility logo

You may modify the logo (e.g. in form of the Photoshop file) to fit your product, as permitted by the CC BY 4.0 license mentioned above.

### Getting the original Photoshop File

You may obtain a layered PSD file for easy customization or creating new variations.
Since GitHub won't allow me to upload the file due to its file size, you can [download the original Photoshop file here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDcJL40qsTT8501t5-vJH7P1p2ccKZ69/view?usp=sharing)

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Donâ€™t have Photoshop? You can edit the layered PSD file using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), a free and open-source image editor that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
