#### Hex
_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction \
**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a small straw doll) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

After successfully hitting a creature with a cantrip spell attack, you can use your reaction to place a Hex on the target, choosing one of their ability scores.
The creature then subtracts a d4 from all saving throws and ability checks related to that ability score.
When the target is reduced to 0 hit points or incapacitated, you can use your reaction to transfer the Hex to another creature you successfully hit with a cantrip spell attack.

**At Higher Levels.**
At 2nd level you may extend your concentration to 4 hours.
At 3rd level 8 hours.
At 5th level, you may extend it until you complete a long rest.
