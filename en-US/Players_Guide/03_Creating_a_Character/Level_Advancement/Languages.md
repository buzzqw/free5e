#### Languages

Your culture determines your default languages that you can read, speak, write, and sign, provided there is no disability or condition that prevents you from doing so.
Your background may grant access to additional languages of your choice.
Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose from the Standard Languages table, or a common language in your campaign.
With your Conductor’s permission, you can choose an exotic language if it fits your background.

Some languages are families with many dialects.
For instance, the Primordial language includes Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects for each elemental plane.
Creatures speaking different dialects of the same language can communicate.

**Signing.**
You must have at least one hand free to communicate by sign, and the creature you are communicating with must be able to see you.
When attempting to make subtle signs, to remain unnoticed you must succeed on a Sleight of Hand check against the passive Perception scores of observers.
