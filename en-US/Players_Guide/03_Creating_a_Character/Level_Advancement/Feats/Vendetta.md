##### Vendetta

Something or someone has had a profound impact on your life—and earned your unending rancor.

- You gain advantage on attack rolls and initiative checks made against creatures that are part of your vendetta, and when making a saving throw to resist an attack, feature, maneuver, spell, or trait from a creature that is part of your vendetta.
  Whether or not a creature is part of your vendetta is at the Conductor’s discretion.
