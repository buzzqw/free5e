##### Polearm Savant

- When you attack with a glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear and no other weapon using the Attack action, as a bonus action you can make a melee attack with the weaponâ€™s opposite end.
  This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
- While you are wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, quarterstaff, or spear, a creature that enters your reach provokes an opportunity attack from you.
  A creature can use its reaction to avoid provoking an opportunity attack from you in this way.
