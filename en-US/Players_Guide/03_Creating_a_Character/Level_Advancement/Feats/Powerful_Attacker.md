##### Powerful Attacker

- When you hit with a melee weapon attack using a weapon with the heavy property, or a versatile weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can use your reaction to make an additional melee weapon attack against a second creature that is also within your reach.
- Before you make a melee attack with a two-handed weapon, or a versatile weapon wielded with two hands, if you are proficient with the weapon and do not have disadvantage you can declare a powerful attack.
  A powerful attack has disadvantage, but on a hit deals 10 extra damage.
