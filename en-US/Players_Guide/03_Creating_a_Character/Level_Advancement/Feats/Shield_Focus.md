##### Shield Focus

You gain the following benefits while wielding a shield:

- When you take the Attack action on your turn, as a bonus action you can make a Shove against a creature within 5 feet of you.
- When you make a Dexterity saving throw against a spell or harmful effect that only targets you, if you aren’t incapacitated you gain a bonus equal to your shield’s Armor Class bonus.
- When you succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you can use your reaction to take no damage by protecting yourself with your shield.
