#### Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each creature’s ability has a score, a number defining its magnitude.
It measures innate capabilities and training in related activities.

A normal human average is 10 or 11, but adventurers and monsters excel in most abilities.
A score of 18 is the highest for humans, while adventurers can reach 20 and monsters and divine beings can reach 30.

Each ability has a modifier, ranging from −5 for a 1 to +10 for a 30, based on the score.
The Ability Scores and Modifiers table lists these modifiers for scores from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).
Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.
