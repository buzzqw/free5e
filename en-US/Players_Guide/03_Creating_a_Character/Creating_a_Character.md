## Creating a Character

As a player, begin by creating a character on the character sheet in the back of this book or a color-coded one at <mark>[LINK]</mark>. <!-- Link to be determined -->
If you're using a paper copy, we recommend writing in an erasable medium like pencil.

1. Think of a fantasy character concept that you'd like to play
2. Choose your class
3. Choose your ancestry
4. Choose your culture
5. Choose your background
6. Determine ability scores
7. Choose your starting equipment
8. Choose starting spells if applicable
9. Add details like appearance, personality, etc.
   Consider drawing a picture of your character.
   It doesn't have to be fancy!
   It's just for your friends!
   (If you'd like to commission a professional portrait of your character, check the credits of this book for some great artists who love illustrating characters!)
