### Cultures

Choose a culture for your character.
While some cultures are closely associated with a specific ancestry, depending on your characterâ€™s past, you may choose any culture for them.
Each culture has unique traits.
You gain all traits associated with your chosen culture, unless otherwise stated.
Characters raised in a culture share common traits.

<!-- Comment by Arkylie (Kilyle) in the Google Doc:
Really have not appreciated charts where you skim through 500 non-applicable things while trying to find the two or three that actually apply.

I grant the "you can choose any one you wish" bit, but even then, you probably have some sort of background hint, such as "I was raised by elves", that narrows it down.

So please sort by race/ancestry first of all, and with the more common ancestries before the more exotic ancestries, and those not related to a race up top.

Comparing Settler, Villager, Cosmopolitan, Nomad, Lone Wanderer etc. in close proximity gives a better view of the reasons you might choose one or the other -- and again, a chart comparing just a small group of related possibilities (in some core mechanical way) is much better than having to slog through a bunch of text (though text can be useful after you've narrowed down your selections).

Seeing all the Elf cultures next to each other, all the Dwarf cultures next to each other, etc., is definitely more useful than scrolling back and forth and (in my case) forgetting 90% of what I just read in the meantime.

P.S. Explain how Cultures and Backgrounds interact with each other, and compare-and-contrast with examples.  E.g. here's a Day Laborer from a rural culture vs. from an urban culture.  Here's a Scholar from a small village vs. an academic enclave.
