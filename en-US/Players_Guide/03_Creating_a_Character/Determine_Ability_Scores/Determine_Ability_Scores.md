#### Determine Ability Scores

Use the following scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Assign each of these numbers to one of your character's six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability.

##### Variant: Rolling Scores
Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest die, and record the total.
Repeat 6 times. Assign each of these numbers to one of your character's six abilities.
(Alternately, use the scores above but randomly assign them.)
Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability.

##### Variant: Ability Score Point Buy
You have 27 points to spend on ability scores.
The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table.
Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability.
