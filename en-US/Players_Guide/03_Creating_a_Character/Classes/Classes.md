### Classes

> **Class Name Changes**
>
> Some class names in Free5e have been updated to remove outdated or problematic references while staying true to their themes.
> They use the same game mechanics as the original classes.
>
> - **Barbarian → Dreadnought:** Replacing a derogatory cultural slur
> - **Druid → Wodewose:** Removed inaccurate and appropriated portrayal of real-world religion
> - **Monk → Adept:** Expanding the concept without appropriating a cultural tradition
> - **Paladin → Vanguard:** Removing the association with a real-world religious conflict

#### Choosing a Class
Your class defines what your character does best and how they contribute to the group.
Some focus on physical combat, others on spellcasting, and some blend both.

- Martial characters rely mostly on weapons and physical skill.
- Half-casters mix martial prowess with limited spellcasting.
- Full casters excel with spells and magic abilities.

Choose a class and a subclass from the class descriptions or from another supplement.
