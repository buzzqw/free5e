###### Twinned Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level.
For example, [Magic Missile](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile) and [Scorching Ray](#Scorching_Ray_scorching_ray) aren’t eligible, but [Ray of Frost](#Ray_of_Frost_ray_of_frost) is.
