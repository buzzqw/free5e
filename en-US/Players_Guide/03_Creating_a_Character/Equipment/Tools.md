#### Tools

A tool aids in tasks like crafting, repairing, forging, or picking locks.
Ancestry, culture, class, background, or feats grant proficiency with specific tools.
Proficiency adds your proficiency bonus to ability checks using that tool, representing broader knowledge.
For instance, the Conductor might ask for a Dexterity check to carve or a Strength check to work with hard wood.
