### Between Free5e and Advanced 5E (A5E)

- **Ancestry and Heritage:**
  Free5e uses Ancestry (biological traits) and Heritage (cultural traits).
  A5E uses Heritage (biological traits) and Culture (social traits).
  When converting to A5E, treat Ancestry as Heritage and choose an appropriate Culture.
  When converting to Free5e, keep Heritage as Ancestry and assign an appropriate Heritage.
- **Backgrounds and Feats:**
  Free5e backgrounds provide proficiencies but no feats.
  A5E backgrounds grant skills, proficiencies, and a feat at 1st level.
  When converting to A5E, select a feat that aligns with the background.
  When converting to Free5e, remove the feat and keep only skill and tool proficiencies.
- **Classes and Level Adjustments:**
  A5E class features are spread across odd-numbered levels, sometimes altering progression.
  Free5e class progression follows the original 5e pattern.
  When converting to A5E, delay the use of an A5E feature that appears earlier than in Free5e.
  If a Free5e feature is missing in A5E, substitute a subclass ability or ASI.
- **Combat & Maneuvers:**
  A5E introduces Combat Maneuvers and a Maneuver Save DC for martial classes.
  Free5e does not include maneuvers as a core mechanic.
  - **Conversion:**
    For A5E, add maneuvers from a Combat Tradition based on the character’s fighting style.
    For Free5e, remove maneuvers and grant proficiency in an extra weapon or Fighting Style.
- **Spellcasting and Magic Rules:**
  A5E introduces prayers, rituals, and wyrd magic alongside spellcasting.
  Free5e uses standard 5e spellcasting.
  - **Conversion:**
    If a spell doesn’t exist in the target system, replace it with a thematically similar spell.
    Adjust spell lists to match A5E’s Arcane, Divine, or Primordial classifications when converting to A5E.
