## Class Name Changes

Some class names in Free5e have been updated to remove outdated or problematic references while staying true to their themes.
They use the same game mechanics as the original classes.

- **Barbarian → Dreadnought:**
  Replacing a derogatory cultural slur
- **Druid → Wodewose:**
  Removed inaccurate and appropriated portrayal of real-world religion
- **Monk → Adept:**
  Expanding the concept without appropriating a cultural tradition
- **Paladin → Vanguard:**
  Removing the association with a real-world religious conflict

## Spell Name Changes

Some spells have been renamed in Free5e, in most cases to honor those who supported the project financially.
