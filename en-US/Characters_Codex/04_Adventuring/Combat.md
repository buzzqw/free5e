## Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.
The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns.
A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**.
The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.
Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
