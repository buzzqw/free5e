#### Saving Throws

A saving throw, also called a save, represents an attempt to resist threats like spells, traps, poison, or diseases.
You don’t usually decide to make one; you’re forced to because your character or monster is at risk.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier.
For instance, use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.
Situational bonuses or penalties can modify a saving throw, and advantage and disadvantage can affect it, as determined by the Conductor.

Each class has proficiency in at least two saving throws.
For example, Wizards are proficient in Intelligence saves.
Proficiency lets a character add their proficiency bonus to saving throws made with a particular ability score.
Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies.

The Difficulty Class (DC) for a saving throw depends on the effect.
For instance, the DC for a spell’s saving throw is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

A successful or failed saving throw is detailed in the effect that allows the save.
Usually, a successful save means no or reduced harm from an effect.
