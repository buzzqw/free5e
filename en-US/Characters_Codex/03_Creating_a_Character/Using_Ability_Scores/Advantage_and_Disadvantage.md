#### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a special ability or spell grants advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, you roll a second d20.
Use the higher roll for advantage and the lower roll for disadvantage.
For instance, with disadvantage, you use a 5, while with advantage, you use a 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll, granting advantage or imposing disadvantage, you don’t roll more than one additional d20.
Even if two favorable situations grant advantage, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you have neither and roll one d20.
This applies even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and a game feature, like the halfling’s _Lucky_ trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice.
For example, a halfling with advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolling a 1 and a 13 could use the _Lucky_ trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through special abilities, actions, spells, or inspiration.
The Conductor can also decide that circumstances influence a roll and grant advantage or impose disadvantage.
