##### Weapon Proficiency

Your ancestry, class, and feats grant proficiency with simple or martial weapons.
Simple weapons, like clubs and maces, are easy to use and suitable for most people.
Martial weapons, like swords and axes, require specialized training and are preferred by warriors for their effectiveness.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon.
If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
