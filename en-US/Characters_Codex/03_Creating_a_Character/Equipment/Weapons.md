### Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in weapons reflecting its focus and your likely use.
Whether you prefer a longsword or longbow, your weapon and skill can mean life or death in adventuring.

The Weapons table lists common fantasy weapons, their prices, weights, damage, and special properties.
Each weapon is classified as **melee** (within 5 feet) or **ranged**.
