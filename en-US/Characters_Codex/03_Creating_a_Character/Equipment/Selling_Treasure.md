### Selling Treasure

Opportunities arise to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in dungeons.
You can sell your loot in towns or settlements if you find buyers.

Undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost in markets.
Monstersâ€™ weapons and armor are rarely in good condition for sale.

Selling magic items is tricky.
Potions and scrolls are easy to find buyers for, but other items are rare and expensive, mostly for wealthy nobles.
Magic items are far more valuable than gold and should be treated as such.

Gems, jewelry, and art objects retain their full value and can be traded for coin or used as currency.
For exceptionally valuable treasures, the Conductor may require you to find a buyer in a large town or community.

Trade goods such as grain, salt, and domesticated beasts are sought after everywhere and so are unlikely to diminish much in value from place to place.
