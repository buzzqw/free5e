###### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
The weapon must have the [two-handed or versatile property](#Weapon_Properties_weapon_properties) for you to gain this benefit.
