###### Empowered Spell

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).
You must use the new rolls.

You can use _Empowered Spell_ even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
