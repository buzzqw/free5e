### Resonant Bond

You can form a greater bond, resonance, with a non-consumable magic item during a rest.
You can only form one resonance at a time.

When you have resonance with an item, gain the following benefits:

- If you meet the prerequisites to become attuned to the item you can attune to it, even if you already have three items that you are currently attuned to, this attunement is not ended by distance or time.
- Once per rest, as a bonus action, you can summon a resonant item, teleporting it instantly to your free hand, so long as it is on the same plane of existence.

You lose the benefits of resonance if another creature gains resonance with the item, or you choose to do so during a rest.
