### Guarded Warrior

- A creature that takes the Disengage action still provokes opportunity attacks from you.
- When a hostile creature that you can pinpoint moves out of your reach, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack and on a hit its Speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
- You can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet that makes an attack against a target other than you if the target does not also have this feat.
