### Destiny’s Call

- An ability score of your choice increases by 1.
- When you gain inspiration, you can choose one party member within 30 feet of you.
  That party member gains inspiration if they don’t have it already.
  Once you inspire a party member in this way, you can’t use this feature again on that party member until you finish a long rest.
