#### Mounted Warrior

- You must be wielding a weapon with the reach property, mounted, and move 20 or more feet towards a target in order to use this feat.
  When you do so, make a melee weapon attack against a creature within your weapon’s reach.
  On a hit, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of your weapons type and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw versus a DC equal to 8+ your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus or be knocked prone.
- When your mount is targeted by an attack, you can instead make yourself the attack’s target.
- When your mount makes a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, it takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
