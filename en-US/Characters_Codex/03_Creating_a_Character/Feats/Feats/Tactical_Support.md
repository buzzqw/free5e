#### Tactical Support

- When using the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the targeted creature can be up to 30 feet away instead of 5 feet.
- If an ally benefiting from your Help action scores a critical hit on the targeted creature, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against that creature.
  Your attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19–20.
  If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range for that attack is increased by 1 (maximum 17–20).
- When a creature is damaged by an attack that was aided by the use of your Help action, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your next turn.
