_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become [invisible](#Conditions_invisible).
Simultaneously, an illusory copy of you appears where you’re standing.
This invisibility ends when you cast a spell but the copy lasts until the spell ends.

You can use an action to move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or behave however you’d like.

You may pinpoint through your copy.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to swap from using your copy’s senses or your own, and vice versa.
While using your copy’s senses you cannot sense your body’s surroundings.

The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it.
