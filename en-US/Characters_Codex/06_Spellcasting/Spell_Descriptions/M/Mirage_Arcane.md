_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Sight \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain within the spell’s area appear as another kind of terrain, tricking all senses (including touch).
The general shape of the terrain remains the same, however.

Structures may be altered, or added where there are none.
Creatures are not disguised, concealed, or added by the spell.

The illusion can be physically interacted with.
Clear terrain can become difficult terrain, and vice versa.
Any part of the illusory terrain such as a boulder, or water collected from an illusory stream, disappears immediately upon leaving the spell’s area.

Creatures with [truesight](#Exploration_Environment_truesight) see through the illusion, but are not immune to its effects.
They may know that the overgrown path is in fact a well-maintained road, but are still impeded by illusory rocks and branches.
