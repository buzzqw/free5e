Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell.
Suggest an activity phrased in a sentence or two.
Up to twelve creatures that can perceive and understand you are magically influenced to follow that course of activity.
The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable.
Asking the targets to perform an action that is obviously harmful to them ends the spell.

A target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can for the duration of the spell or until the target has carried out the activity.

You may specify trigger conditions that cause a target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.

Any damage done to a target by you or an ally ends the spell for that creature.
