_6th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

Suggest an activity phrased in a sentence or two.
The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable.
You may specify trigger conditions that cause a target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.

Up to twelve creatures that can perceive and understand you, and that are not immune to being charmed, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be magically influenced to follow that course of activity.

On a failed save, a target pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability for the duration of the spell or until the target has carried out the activity.

Asking the targets to perform an action that is obviously harmful to them ends the spell.
Any damage done to a target by you or an ally ends the spell for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.**
When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration of the spell increases to 10 days.
When cast using an 8th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 30 days.
When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration increases to a year and a day.
