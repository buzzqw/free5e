_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 10 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** 1 hour

Magical energies surround a 10-foot radius, 20 feet high cylinder and stop celestials, elementals, fey, fiends or undead (designate one or more) from willingly entering by nonmagical means.

Creatures of the designated type have disadvantage when attacking creatures within the area and are unable to charm, frighten, or possess creatures within the area.
When a designated creature attempts to teleport or use interplanar travel to enter the area, it makes a Charisma saving throw or its attempt fails.

You may also choose to invert this spell, trapping a creature of your chosen type within the area and prevent it from acting outside of said area

**At Higher Levels.**
The spellâ€™s duration increases by 1 hour for every slot level above 3rd.
