_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large, translucent hand made of force in an unoccupied space you can pinpoint.

The hand doesn’t fill its space and has AC 20, Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 10 (+0), maneuver DC 18, and hit points equal to your hit point maximum.
The spell ends early if it is dropped to 0 hit points.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then choose one of the following.

- **Shove:**
  The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller.
  On a success, the hand pushes the creature in a direction of your choosing for up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to 5 times your spellcasting ability modifier, and remains within 5 feet of it.
- **Smash:**
  Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of the hand.
  On a hit, the hand deals `4d8` force damage.
- **Snatch:**
  The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller.
  On a success, the creature is grappled by the hand.
  You can use a bonus action to crush a creature grappled by the hand, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to `2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier`.
- **Stop:**
  Until the hand is given another command it moves to stay between you and a creature of your choice, granting you three-quarters cover against the chosen creature.
  A creature with a Strength score of 26 or less cannot move through the hand’s space, and stronger creatures treat the hand as difficult terrain.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage from _Smash_ increases by 2d8 and the damage from Snatch increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 5th.
