_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp) \
**Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body becomes unconscious and incapable of being roused, while your soul enters the vessel used as a material component.

Souls within the jar are aware of their surroundings as though they occupied that space.

While your soul is within the jar, you can, as an action, project your soul to a target within range, either returning it to your body or attempting to possess a humanoid creature.
You can take no other actions.
You may not target creatures protected by the [Protection from Evil and Good](#Protection_from_Evil_and_Good_protection_from_evil_and_good) or [Magic Circle](#Magic_Circle_magic_circle) spells.
A creature you try to possess makes a Charisma saving throw or your soul moves from your vessel and into its body.
The creature’s soul is now ensnared within the container.
On a successful save, the creature resists and you may not attempt to possess it for 24 hours.

Upon possessing a creature, you gain control of it.
Replace your game statistics with the creature’s, except your Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom scores.
Your own cultural traits and class features also remain, and you may not use the creature’s cultural traits or class features (if it has any).

During possession, you may use an action to return to the vessel if it is within range, returning the host creature to its body.
If the host body dies while you are possessing it, the creature also dies and you must make a Charisma save against the spellcasting DC of the spell when it was cast.
On a success you return to the container if it’s within range.
Otherwise, you die.

If the vessel is destroyed, the spell ends and your soul returns to your body if it’s within range.
If your body is out of range or dead when you try to return, you die.

Souls in the jar other than those of the caster cannot take actions or movement.
If the vessel is destroyed while occupied by a creature other than yourself, the creature returns to its body if the body is alive and within range.
Otherwise, the creature dies.

The vessel is destroyed when the spell ends.
