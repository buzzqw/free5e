_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

You reshape a square of clay, dirt, or sand up to 40 feet per side, changing its elevation or creating and eliminating holes, walls, and pillars.
The only limitation is that the elevation change may not exceed half the areaâ€™s horizontal dimensions.
For example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to include 20-foot high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain elevation of 20 feet or less.
Changes that result in unstable terrain are subject to collapse.

Changes take 10 minutes to complete, after which you can choose another area to affect.
Due to the slow speed of transformation, it is nearly impossible for creatures to be hurt or captured by the spell.

This spell has no effect on stone, objects crafted from stone, or plants, though these objects will shift based on changes in the area.
