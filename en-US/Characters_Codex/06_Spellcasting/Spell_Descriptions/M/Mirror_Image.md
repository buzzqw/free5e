_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 1 minute

A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear, sharing your space.
These copies move with you and mimic your behavior, creating confusion as to which is real.
You can use an action to dismiss them.

Each time you’re targeted by a creature’s attack, roll a d20 to determine whether it targets you or a copy.

With 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted.
With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.

A copy’s AC is `10 + your Dexterity modifier`, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed.
It may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
All other damage and effects have no impact.

Attacking creatures that have [truesight](#Exploration_Environment_truesight), cannot see, have parasense, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to concentration, up to 1 hour.
