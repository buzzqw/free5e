_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moon seed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light.
When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `2d10` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw.
On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spellâ€™s light.

On your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.
