One willing creature is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would read its emotions or thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.

This immunity extends even to the [Wish](#Wish_wish) spell, and magical effects or spells of similar power that would affect the targetâ€™s mind or gain information about it.
