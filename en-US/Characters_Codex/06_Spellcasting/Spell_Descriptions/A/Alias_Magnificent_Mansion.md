_7th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 300 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure an extradimensional residence.
It has one glittering entrance that is in a space of your choosing, and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall.
You and any designated creatures may enter your mansion while the portal is open.
You may open and close the portal while you are within 30 feet of it.
Once closed the entrance is invisible.
The mansion:

- Has an opulent entrance hall.
- Has a floorplan you chose, made up of fifty or fewer contiguous 10-foot cubes.
  All furniture and decor are chosen by you
- Contains enough Supply for 5 x your proficiency bonus creatures.

A staff of translucent, lustrous servants dwell within, obeying your comments without question and capable of performing the same nonhostile actions as a human servant, though they cannot leave the mansion.

All objects and furnishings belonging to the mansion evaporate into shimmering smoke when they leave it.
Any creature within the mansion when the spell ends is expelled into an unoccupied space near the entrance.
