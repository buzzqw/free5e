_2nd-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

With the aid of a divining tool, you receive an omen about the success or failure of a course of action that you plan to embark upon within the next 30 minutes.
The Conductor chooses from the following:

- Fortunate omen (good results)
- Calamity omen (bad results)
- Ambivalence omen (both good and bad results)
- No omen (results that aren’t especially good or bad)

This omen does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases.
The Conductor makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.
