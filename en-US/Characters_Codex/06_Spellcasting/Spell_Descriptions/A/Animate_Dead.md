_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (two copper coins) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You animate a mortal’s remains to become your undead servant.

If the spell is cast upon bones you create a skeleton, and if cast upon a corpse you can choose to create a skeleton or a zombie.
The Conductor has the undead’s statistics.

While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command any undead you created with this spell.
When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command.
You may decide the creature’s exact action and move, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area, which it follows until the task is complete or you issue it a new command.
If not given a command, the undead only defends itself.

The undead is under your control for 24 hours unless you cast this spell on it before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours.
Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 4 of your previously-animated undead instead of animating a new one.
When no longer under your control, the undead no longer obeys your commands.

**At Higher Levels.**
You create or maintain control over 2 additional undead for each slot level above 3rd.
