_1st-level abjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire) \
**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion.
Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube.
Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area.
When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t set off the alarm.
You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area.
This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
