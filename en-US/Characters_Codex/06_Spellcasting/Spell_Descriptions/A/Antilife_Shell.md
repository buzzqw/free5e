A translucent barrier pops into existence around you in a 10-foot radius.
The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its surface.

The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.

The spell ends if you move so that a living creature is forced to pass through the barrier.
