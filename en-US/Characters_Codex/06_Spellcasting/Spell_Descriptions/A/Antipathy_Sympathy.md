Designate a species or ancestry of intelligent creature, such as dragons.
A huge or smaller object or creature or a 200-foot cube now causes either antipathy or sympathy for the specified creatures for the duration of the spell.
A creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect the first time it sees or comes within 60 feet of the target, every 24 hours thereafter, and whenever it ends its turn neither within 60 feet nor within sight of the target.
When a designated creature successfully saves against the effects of the spell, it immediately understands it was under a magical effect and is immune to this spellâ€™s effects for 1 minute.

- **Antipathy.**
  When a designated creature can pinpoint the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened on a failure.
  While frightened the creature must use its movement to move away from the target until it can no longer pinpoint the target.
  If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can no longer pinpoint it, it is no longer frightened until it can pinpoint the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
- **Sympathy.**
  When a designated creature can pinpoint the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw.
  On a failure, the creature uses its movement on each of its turns to move into the area or within reach of the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target.
  If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect.
