_4th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a mushroom-shaped piece of wood inside a universal joint) \
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

You create an invisible, floating magical eye through which you can see.
The eye has normal vision, darkvision to a range of 30 feet, and it can look in every direction.

You can use an action to move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction as long as it remains on the same plane of existence.
The eye can pass through openings as small as 1 inch across but otherwise its movement is blocked by solid barriers.
