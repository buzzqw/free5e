_Enchantment cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You verbally insult or mock one creature so viciously its mind is seared.
If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `1d4` psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
