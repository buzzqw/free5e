_Enchantment cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You verbally insult or mock one creature so viciously its mind is seared.
As long as the target hears you (understanding your words is not required) it takes `1d6` psychic damage and has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
