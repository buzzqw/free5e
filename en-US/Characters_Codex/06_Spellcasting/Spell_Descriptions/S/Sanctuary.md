You protect a creature from intentional harm.
When a creature makes an attack against or casts a harmful spell against the target, it must first make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the attacking creature must choose a different target or it loses the attack or spell.
This spell doesnâ€™t protect the target from area effects.

This spell ends early when the target attacks or casts a spell that affects a creature against its will.
