_9th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You take the form of a creature of a Challenge Rating equal to or lower than your level.
The creature cannot be an undead or a construct, and it must be a creature you have observed.
You change into the average version of that creature, and do not gain any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

Until the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit points, your statistics (except your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores) are replaced by those of the chosen creature.
You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies as well as gaining the creature’s, keeping the higher of the two if you share one in common.
You keep all of your features, skills, and traits gained from your class, ancestry, culture, background, or other sources, and can use them as long as the creature is physically able to do so.
You do not keep any special senses, such as darkvision.
You can only speak if the creature is typically capable of speech.
You cannot use legendary actions or lair actions.
Your gear melds into the new form.
Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you leave the form.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.
If the spell’s effect on you ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form and knocks you unconscious if the damage reduces you to 0 hit points.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change into another form of your choice.
The new form follows all the rules as the previous form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than your previous form, you keep the previous form’s hit points.
