You send a message of 25 words or less to one creature you are familiar with.
It recognizes you as the sender and can reply immediately in kind.
The message travels across any distance and into other planes of existence.
If the target is on a different plane of existence than you, there is a 5% chance it doesnâ€™t receive your message.
A target with an Intelligence score of at least 1 understands your message as you intend it (whether you share a language or not).
