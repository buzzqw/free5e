Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell.
You create a burst of radiant sunlight that fills the area. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute if it fails a Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell.
A creature blinded by this spell repeats its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a successful save.

This spell dispels any magical darkness in its area. This light is sunlight.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using a 9th-level spell slot the damage increases by `2d6`.
