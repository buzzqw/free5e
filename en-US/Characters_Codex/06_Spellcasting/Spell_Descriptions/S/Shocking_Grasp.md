_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Electricity arcs from your fingertips to shock one creature.
Make a melee spell attack (with advantage if the target is wearing metal armor).
On a hit, you deal `1d8` lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn as the electricity courses through its body.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
