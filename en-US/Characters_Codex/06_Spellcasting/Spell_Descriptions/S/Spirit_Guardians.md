_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self (15-foot radius) \
**Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

When learning the spell, choose whether the spell deals radiant or necrotic damage.

You call down spirits of divine fury, filling the 15-foot radius around you with flitting spectral forms.
You choose the form taken by the spirits.
Creatures of your choice halve their Speed while in the area.
When an affected creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes `3d8` of the chosen damage type (see above) or half that on a successful Wisdom saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
