_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an illusory visual image of a creature, object, or other visible effect within a 15-foot cube.
The illusion cannot produce sound or smell, and items and other creatures pass through it.

As an action, you can move the image to any point within range.
The imageâ€™s movement can be natural and lifelike.

A creature that touches the image recognizes it as an illusion.
A creature can also spend an action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to determine if the image is an illusion.
On a success, it is able to see through the image.
