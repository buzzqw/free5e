_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 12 hours \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to make a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell) \
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You sculpt an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time from ice and snow.
The duplicate looks exactly like the target and uses all the statistics of the original, though it is formed without any gear, and has only half of the target’s hit point maximum.
The duplicate is a creature and can take actions.
If the target is able to cast spells, the duplicate cannot cast spells of 7th-level or higher.

The duplicate is friendly to you and your allies.
It follows your orders, and moves and acts on your turn in combat.
It is a static creature and it does not learn, age, or grow, so it never increases in levels and cannot regain any spent spell slots.

When the simulacrum is damaged you can repair it in an alchemy lab using components worth 100 gold per hit point it regains.
When reduced to 0 hit points the simulacrum crumbles into snow and melts away immediately.
The simulacrum is also destroyed if you cast this spell again.
