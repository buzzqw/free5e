_5th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can observe a specific creature on the same plane of existence as you or a location you’ve observed before that you choose.
The difficulty of the saving throw for this spell is modified by your knowledge of the target and whether you possess a physical item with a connection to the target.

On a failed save, you can see and hear the target through an invisible sensor that appears within 10 feet of it and moves with the target.
Any creature who can see invisibility or rolls a critical success on its saving throw perceives the sensor as a fist-sized glowing orb hovering in the air. Creatures cannot sense you through the sensor.

If you choose to target a location, the sensor appears at that location and is immobile.
