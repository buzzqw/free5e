_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket) \
**Duration:** 1 minute

You put `4d10` hit points worth of creatures into a deep enchanted sleep.
Starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets within the area fall unconscious in ascending order according to their hit points.
Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends, they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake them.

As each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target.
A targetâ€™s hit points must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect.

Constructs and undead are not affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.**
The spell affects an additional `2d10` hit points worth of creatures for each slot level above 1st.
