You magically hide away a willing creature or object.
The target becomes invisible, and it cannot be traced or detected by divination or [Scrying](#Scrying_scrying) sensors.
If the target is a living creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation and stops aging.

The spell ends when the target takes damage or a condition you set occurs.
The condition must pertain to creatures or objects within 1 mile of the target or be visible within that distance.
