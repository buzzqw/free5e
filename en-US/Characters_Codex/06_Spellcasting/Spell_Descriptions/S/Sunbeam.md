Radiant sunlight streaks from your hand.
Each creature in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide takes `6d8` radiant damage and is blinded for 1 round if it fails a Constitution saving throw.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action on subsequent turns to create a new beam of sunlight.

A mote of brilliant radiance lingers on your hand until the spell ends, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light an additional 30 feet.
