_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 150 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause sharp spikes and thorns to sprout in a 20-foot radius, making it difficult terrain.
When a creature enters or moves within the area, it takes `2d4` piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

Your magic causes the ground to look natural.
A creature that canâ€™t sense the area when the spell is cast can spot the hazardous terrain just before entering it by making a Perception check against your spell save DC.
