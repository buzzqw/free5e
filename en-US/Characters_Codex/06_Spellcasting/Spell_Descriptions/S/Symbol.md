_7th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a potent glyph on one object or a surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter, setting a magical trap for your enemies.
If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends.
Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph.
The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it.
You can specify certain creatures which don’t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase.
Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.

When triggered, the glyph sheds dim light in a 60-foot radius for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature within the sphere’s area is targeted by the glyph, as are creatures that enter the sphere for the first time on a turn.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following effects.

- **Death:**
  Creatures in the area make a Constitution saving throw, taking `10d10` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.
- **Discord:**
  Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bicker and squabble with other creatures for 1 minute.
While bickering, a creature cannot meaningfully communicate and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- **Fear:**
  Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](#Conditions_frightened) for 1 minute.
  While frightened, a creature drops anything it is holding and must try to move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns.
- **Hopelessness:**
  Creatures in the area must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be filled with despair for 1 minute.
  While despairing, a creature can’t attack or target any creature with harmful effects.
- **Overwhelm:**
  Each target must make an Intelligence save.
  On a failed save, the target is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) for 1 minute.
  While incapacitated, the target can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The Conductor controls its movement, which is erratic.
- **Pain:**
  Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) for 1 minute.
- **Sleep:**
  Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall [unconscious](#Conditions_unconscious) for 10 minutes.
  A sleeping creature awakens if it takes damage or an action is used to wake it.
- **Stunning:**
  Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [stunned](#Conditions_stunned) for 1 minute.
