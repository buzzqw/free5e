A torrent of wind erupts from your hand in a direction you choose.
Each creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area on its turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet from you in the direction of the line.

When approaching you, any creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every foot moved.

The blast of wind extinguishes small fires and disperses gas or vapor.

You can use a bonus action to change the direction of the gust.
