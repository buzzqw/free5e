_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** 8 hours

A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can pinpoint.
The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.

Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.
The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.
