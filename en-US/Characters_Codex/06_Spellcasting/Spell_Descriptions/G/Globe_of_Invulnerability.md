**Range:** Self (10-foot radius) \
**Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends) \

An immobile, glimmering sphere forms around you.
Any spell of 5th-level or lower cast from outside the sphere can’t affect anything inside the sphere, even if it’s cast with a higher level spell slot.
Targeting something inside the sphere or including the globe’s space in an area has no effect on anything inside.

**At Higher Levels.**
The barrier blocks spells of one spell level higher for each slot level above 6th.
