_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 300 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A cloud of biting, stinging insects lightly obscures the area, spreads around corners, and is considered difficult terrain.
When the cloud appears and a creature is in it, when a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn, or when a creature ends its turn within the cloud it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `4d10` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 5th.
