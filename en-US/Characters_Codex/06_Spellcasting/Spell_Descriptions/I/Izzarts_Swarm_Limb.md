_1st-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 1 hour

You summon a swarm of fey spirits that take the form of a swarm of beasts of Challenge Rating 1/2 or lower shaped as an adaptive limb, responding to telepathic commands like the appendage it's replacing.
This spell cannot add an extra limb beyond those typical for your ancestry.

The summoned swarm is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The swarm gets no actions of its own, but you can use its bite as an unarmed attack.

The swarm can detach on command as a bonus action.
While detached, it retains its link and can attack and follow simple commands up to 30 feet away from you.
If it moves further away, the spell ends.
