_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 150 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A cloud of burning embers and smoke heavily obscures the area, spreading around corners and through cracks.
When the cloud appears and a creature is in it, when a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn, or when a creature ends its turn within the cloud it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

The cloud can be dispelled by a wind of at least 10 miles per hour.
After it is cast, the cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.
