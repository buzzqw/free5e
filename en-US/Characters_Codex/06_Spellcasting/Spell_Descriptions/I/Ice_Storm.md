A bombardment of jagged ice erupts throughout the target area.
All creatures in the area take `2d8` bludgeoning damage and `4d6` cold damage on a failed Dexterity save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Large chunks of ice turn the area into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.**
The bludgeoning damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 4th.
