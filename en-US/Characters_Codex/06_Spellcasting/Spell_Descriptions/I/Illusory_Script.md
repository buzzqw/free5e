_1st-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** 10 days

You inscribe a message onto a piece of paper or other material suitable to write on and wrap it in illusion until the spell ends.
You and any creatures that you designate when the spell is cast perceive the message as normal.
You may choose to have other creatures view the message as an unrecognized or incomprehensible magical writing, or as a different message.
If you choose to create another message, you can change the handwriting and the language that the message is written in to any language which you know.

If the spell is dispelled, both the message and its illusory mask disappear.

The true message can be perceived by any creature with [truesight](#Exploration_Environment_truesight).
