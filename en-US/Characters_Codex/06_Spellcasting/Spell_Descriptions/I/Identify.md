You learn an object’s magical properties along with how to use them.
This spell also reveals whether or not a targeted item requires attunement and how many charges it has.
You also learn what spells, if any, were used to create the item and what, if any, spells are currently affecting the item.

Alternatively, you learn any spells that are currently affecting a targeted creature.

What this spell can reveal is at the Conductor’s discretion, and some powerful and rare magics are immune to identify.
