_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You seek aid from an otherworldly entity known to you: a god, primordial, demon prince, or cosmic power.
It sends a celestial, elemental, or fiend loyal to it to aid you, appearing in an unoccupied space within range.
You can specify a creature’s name when casting this spell, but the Conductor may choose a different one.

The creature is under no obligation to act in a particular way.
You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment.
The task can range from simple to complex, and communication is required for bargaining.
Payment can take various forms, such as gold, magic items, living sacrifices, or treasure.

A task measured in minutes requires 100 gp per minute, in hours 1,000 gp per hour, and in days (up to 10 days) 10,000 gp per day.
The Conductor can adjust these payments based on circumstances.
If the task aligns with the creature’s ethos, payment may be halved or waived.
Nonhazardous tasks typically require half the suggested payment, while dangerous tasks may require a greater gift.
Creatures rarely accept suicidal tasks.

After completing the task or the agreed-upon duration, the creature returns to its home plane, reporting back if appropriate.
If payment cannot be agreed upon, the creature returns immediately.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.
