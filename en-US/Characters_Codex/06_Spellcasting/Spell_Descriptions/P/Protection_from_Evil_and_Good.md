One willing creature is protected against the following types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target and are unable to charm, frighten, or possess the target.
If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against that effect.
