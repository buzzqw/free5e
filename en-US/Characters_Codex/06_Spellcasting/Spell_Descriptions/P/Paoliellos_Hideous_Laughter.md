_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A creature of your choice that you can pinpoint within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if it fails a Wisdom saving throw.
The target falls prone, becomes incapacitated, and cannot stand.

Until the spell ends, at the end of each of the targetâ€™s turns and when it suffers damage, the target may attempt another saving throw (with advantage if triggered by damage).
On a successful save, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.**
Target an additional creature within 30 feet of the original for each slot level above 1st.
