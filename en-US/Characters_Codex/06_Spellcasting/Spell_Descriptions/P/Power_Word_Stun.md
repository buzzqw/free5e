You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can pinpoint within range, leaving it dumbfounded.
If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [stunned](#Conditions_stunned).
Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
