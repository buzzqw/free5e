You create a flame in your hand which lasts until the spell ends and does no harm to you or your equipment.
The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

The spell ends when you dismiss it, cast it again, or attack with the flame.
As part of casting the spell or as an action on a following turn, you can fling the flame at a creature within 30 feet, making a ranged spell attack that deals `1d8` fire damage.

This spellâ€™s damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).
