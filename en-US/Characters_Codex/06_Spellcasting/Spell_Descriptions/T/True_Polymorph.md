_9th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

One unattended nonmagical object or one creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger is transformed until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends.
You can make the transformation permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration.

**Creature into Creature.**
If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating).
The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form.
It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.
If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.
As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.

The target's gear melds into the new form.
The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
\
**Object into Creature:**
The target is transformed into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size isn’t larger than the object’s size and it has a Challenge Rating of 9 or less.
The creature is friendly to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns, but only you dictate its actions and movement.
However, the Conductor resolves the creature’s actions and movement and has its statistics.

If the spell becomes permanent, your control over the creature ends.
At this point its attitude towards you is determined by how you treated it previously.
\
**Creature into Object:**
You turn the target and whatever it is wearing and carrying into an object.
The target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen object and it retains no memory of this time.
When the spell ends it reverts to its previous form.
