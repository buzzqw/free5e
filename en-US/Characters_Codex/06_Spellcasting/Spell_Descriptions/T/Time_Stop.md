When you cast the spell, the world is frozen in time while you take `1d4 + 1` turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

The spell ends if you move more than 1,000 feet from where you cast the spell, or if you affect either a creature other than yourself or an object worn or carried by someone else.
