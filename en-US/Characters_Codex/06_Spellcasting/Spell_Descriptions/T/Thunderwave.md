_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self (15-foot cube) \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a wave of thunderous force, damaging creatures and pushing them back.
Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `2d8` thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

Unsecured objects completely within the area are also pushed 10 feet away from you.
The thunderous boom of the spell is audible out to 300 feet.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.
