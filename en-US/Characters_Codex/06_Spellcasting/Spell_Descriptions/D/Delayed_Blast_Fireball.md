_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 150 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A glowing bead of light flies from you and hovers at a point you choose until you end the spell—either because your concentration is broken or because you choose to end it—and then detonates.
Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `12d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The fire spreads around corners, and it damages and ignites any flammable unattended objects in the area.

If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by `1d6`.

If the bead is touched before the spell ends, the creature touching the bead makes a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failure, the bead detonates.
On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet, moving the area with it, and the bead then detonates.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 7th.
