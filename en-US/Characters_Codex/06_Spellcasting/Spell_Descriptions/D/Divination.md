_4th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You ask your higher powers a single question about something that will (or could) happen in the next 7 days.
The Conductor offers a truthful reply, which may be cryptic or even nonverbal as appropriate to the being in question.
The reply does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases.
The Conductor makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.
