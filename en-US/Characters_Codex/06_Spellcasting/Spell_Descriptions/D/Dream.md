_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Special \
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird) \
**Duration:** 8 hours

You designate a _messenger_, which may be you or a willing creature you touch, to enter a trance.
The _messenger_ remains aware of its surroundings while in the trance but cannot take actions or move.
Until the spell ends, you manipulate the dreams of another creature that you know, the _dreamer_, that is on the same [plane](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence) as the _messenger_.
During the duration of the spell, the _messenger_ knows when the _dreamer_ is asleep.
The _messenger_ can end the trance at any time, ending the spell.

While the _dreamer_ is asleep the _messenger_ can appear in its dreams and can speak and act in the dream.
The _messenger_ can also manipulate the dream, creating objects, landscapes, and various other sensory sensations.
The _dreamer_ remembers the dream in perfect detail when it wakes.

You can choose to let the _messenger_ terrorize the _dreamer_.
The _messenger_ can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the _dreamer_ must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If you have a portion of the _dreamer’s_ body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw.
On a failed save, echoes of the messenger’s fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the _dreamer’s_ sleep and prevents it from benefiting from the rest.
In addition, upon waking, the _dreamer_ suffers a level of exhaustion, up to a maximum of 3.

The dreamer cannot be a creature that doesn’t sleep or dream (such as elves).
