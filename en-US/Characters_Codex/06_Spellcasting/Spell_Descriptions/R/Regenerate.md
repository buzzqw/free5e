_7th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water) \
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature, causing its body to spontaneously heal itself.
The target immediately regains `4d8 + 15` hit points and regains an additional 10 hit points per minute (1 hit point at the start of each of its turns).

If the target is missing any body parts, the lost parts are restored after 2 minutes.
If a severed part is held against the stump, the limb instantaneously reattaches itself.
