_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell ends a curse inflicted with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower.
If the curse was instead inflicted by a feature or trait, the spell ends a curse inflicted by a creature of challenge rating 6 or lower.
If cast on a cursed object of Rare or lesser rarity, this spell breaks the owner’s attunement to the item (although it does not end the curse on the object).

**At Higher Levels.**
For each slot level above 3rd, the spell ends a curse inflicted either by a spell one level higher or by a creature with a challenge rating two higher.
When using a 6th-level spell slot, the spell breaks the owner’s attunement to a Very Rare item.
When using a 9th-level spell slot, the spell breaks the owner’s attunement to a Legendary item.
