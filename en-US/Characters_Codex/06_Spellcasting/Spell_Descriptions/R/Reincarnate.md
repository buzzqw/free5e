_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You return one dead humanoid or piece of a dead humanoid (dead no more than 10 days) to life, provided the target’s soul is willing and able to return to its body.
If you only have a piece of the target, the spell reforms a new adult body for the soul to inhabit.
Once reincarnated the target remembers everything from its former life, and retains all its proficiencies, cultural traits, and class features.
The target’s ancestry traits change according to its new form.
The Conductor chooses the form of the new body, or rolls on the following table.
