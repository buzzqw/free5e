**Casting Time:** 1 action \

**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Gravity reverses in the area.
Any creatures or objects not anchored to the ground fall upward until they reach the top of the area.
A creature may make a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the fall by grabbing hold of something.
If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the affected creatures and objects impact against it with the same force as a downward fall.
When an object or creature reaches the top of the area, it remains suspended there until the spell ends.

When the spell ends, all affected objects and creatures fall back down.
