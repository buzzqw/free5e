You plague creatures with nightmares.
Each creature in a 30-foot sphere makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened until the spell ends.
At the end of each of a frightened creatureâ€™s turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or it takes `4d10` psychic damage.
On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
