_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface.
The wall can be up to 60 feet long (it does not have to be a straight line; sections of the wall can angle as long as they are contiguous), 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick.
The wall blocks sight.

When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall (chosen when the spell is cast) deals `5d8` fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall.
A creature also takes that damage when it enters the wall itself for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
The other side deals no damage.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 4th.
