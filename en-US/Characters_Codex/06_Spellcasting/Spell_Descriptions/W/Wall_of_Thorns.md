You create a wall of thorny vines and brush that blocks line of sight on a solid surface.
You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.

When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `7d8` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, but at a cost.
It must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves through the wall.
The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failure, it takes `7d8` slashing damage, or half as much on a successful save.

**At Higher Levels.**
Damage dealt by the wall increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 6th.
