_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A 60-foot radius storm cloud that is 10 feet high appears in a space 100 feet above you.
If there is no available space for the storm cloud, the spell fails.

On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can call down a bolt of lightning to a point directly beneath any part of the cloud.
Each creature within 5 feet of the point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d10` lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

If you are outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, you take control of the storm instead of creating a new cloud and the spellâ€™s damage is increased by `1d10`.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
