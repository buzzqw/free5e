_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp) \
**Duration:** 10 days

As part of this spell, cast a spell of 5th-level or lower that has a casting time of 1 action, expending the spell slots for both spells.
The second spell must target you, and doesnâ€™t target others even if it normally would.

Describe the circumstances under which the second spell should be cast.
It is automatically triggered the first time these circumstances are met.
This spell ends when the second spell is triggered, when you cast Contingency again, or if the material component for it is not on your person.
