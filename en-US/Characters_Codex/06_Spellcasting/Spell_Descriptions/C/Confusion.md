This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action.
Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

| &#160;d10&#160; | Behavior                                             |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|        1.       | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |
|       2–6       | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn. |
|       7–8       | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |
|       9–10      | The creature can act and move normally.              |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw.
If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

**At Higher Levels.**
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
