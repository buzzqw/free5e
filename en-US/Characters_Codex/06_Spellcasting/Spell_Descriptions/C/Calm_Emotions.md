_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Strong and harmful emotions are suppressed within the area.
You can choose one of the following two effects, which applies to each humanoid in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose that fails a Charisma saving throw:

- Suppress the charmed or frightened conditions, though they resume when the spell ends (time spent suppressed counts against a conditionâ€™s duration).
- Suppress hostile feelings towards creatures of your choice until the spell ends.
  This suppression ends for a creature if the creature is attacked or harmed or sees its allies being attacked or harmed.

**At Higher Levels.**
The spell area increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
