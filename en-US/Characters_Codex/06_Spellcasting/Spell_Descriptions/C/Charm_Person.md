Until the spell ends, one humanoid is charmed by you and friendly towards you unless it succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw.
You must have line of sight to the target and it has advantage on its saving throw to resist the spell if you or your companions are fighting it.

The spell ends if you or your companions do anything harmful towards the target.
The target knows it was charmed by you when the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.**
For each slot level above 1st, you affect one additional target that is within 30 feet of other targets.
