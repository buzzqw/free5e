_3rd-level divination_

An invisible sensor is created within the spellâ€™s range in a location familiar to you (a place observed before) or an obvious and unfamiliar location (behind a door, around a corner, and so on).
The sensor cannot be moved, targeted, or attacked.

Choose seeing or hearing when you cast the spell.
You may use that sense through the sensor as if you were there.
As an action, you may switch which sense you are using through the sensor.

A creature able to see invisible things sees a 4-inch diameter glowing, ethereal orb.
