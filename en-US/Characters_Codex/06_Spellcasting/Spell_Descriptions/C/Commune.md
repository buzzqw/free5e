_5th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water) \
**Duration:** 1 minute

You contact a personified source of divine power and ask up to 3 yes/no questions.
You must complete your questions before the spell ends.
You receive a correct answer for each question, unless the being does not know.
When the being does not know, you receive "unclear" as an answer.
The being does not try to deceive, and the Conductor may offer a short phrase as an answer if necessary.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a no answer increases.
The Conductor makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.
