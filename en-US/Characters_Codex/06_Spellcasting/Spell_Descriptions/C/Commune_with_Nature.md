_5th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Until the spell ends, your spirit bonds with that of nature and you learn about the surrounding land.
When cast outdoors the spell reaches 3 miles around you, and in natural underground settings it reaches only 300 feet.
The spell fails if you are in a heavily constructed area, such as a dungeon or town.

You learn up to 3 facts of your choice about the surrounding area:

- Terrain and bodies of water
- Common flora, fauna, minerals, and peoples
- Any unnatural creatures in the area
- Weaknesses in planar boundaries
- Built structures
