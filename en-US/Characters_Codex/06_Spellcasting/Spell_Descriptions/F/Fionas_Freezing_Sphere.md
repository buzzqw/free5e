_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 300 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A freezing globe streaks to a point within range and explodes, dealing `10d6` cold damage to creatures in the area.
Liquid in the area is frozen to a depth of 6 inches for 1 minute.
Any creature caught in the ice can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to escape.

Instead of firing the globe, you can hold it in your hand.
If you handle it carefully, it wonâ€™t explode until a minute after you cast the spell.
At any time, you or another creature can strike the globe, throw it up to 60 feet, or use it as a slingstone, causing it to explode on impact.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 6th.
