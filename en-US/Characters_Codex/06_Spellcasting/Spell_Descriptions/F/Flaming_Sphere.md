_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears within range, lasting for the duration.
It casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet, and ignites unattended flammable objects it touches.
You can use a bonus action to move the sphere up to 30 feet.
It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or obstacles 5 feet tall.

If you move the sphere into a creature, the sphere ends its movement for that turn and the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `2d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw against the sphereâ€™s damage.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 2nd.
