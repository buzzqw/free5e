Each creature in the area becomes frightened until the spell ends and must drop whatever it is holding unless it succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw.

On each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell uses its action to take the Dash action and move away from you if possible.
When the creature ends its turn while it does not have line of sight to you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the spellâ€™s effects on itself on a successful save.
