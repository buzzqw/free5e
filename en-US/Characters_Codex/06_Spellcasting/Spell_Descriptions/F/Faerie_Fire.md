Each object in a 20-foot cube is outlined in light (your choice of color) and sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in light and shed light in the same way until the spell ends.

Any attack roll against an affected object or creature has advantage.
The spell also negates the benefits of invisibility on affected creatures and objects.
