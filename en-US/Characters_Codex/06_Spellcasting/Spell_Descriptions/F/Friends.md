_Enchantment Cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** S \
**Duration:** 1 round

Once before the start of your next turn, when you make a Charisma ability check against one nonhostile creature, you gain expertise.
If you roll a 1 on the ability or skill check, the target realizes its judgment was influenced by magic and may become hostile.
