_6th-level abjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp) \
**Duration:** 1 day

You protect an area up to 40,000 square feet and up to 30 feet tall against magical travel.
Creatures can’t teleport into the area, use a magical portal to enter it, or travel into it from another [plane of existence](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence), such as the Astral or Ethereal Plane.
The spell’s area can’t overlap with another Forbiddance spell.

The spell damages specific types of trespassing creatures.
Choose either radiant or necrotic damage and one or more of celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
When such a creature first enters the area on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes `5d10` damage of the type you chose.
You may also designate a password.
A creature speaking this password as it enters takes no damage from the spell.

After casting this spell on the same area for 30 consecutive days it becomes permanent until dispelled.
This final casting to make the spell permanent consumes its material components.
