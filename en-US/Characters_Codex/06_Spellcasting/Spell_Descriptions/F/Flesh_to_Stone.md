_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature of flesh and blood becomes restrained as it begins to turn to stone.
On a successful saving throw, the target isnâ€™t affected.

<!-- TODO This is CONSIDERABLY more severe than the WotC version of the spell. Do we really want to sue this? -->
A creature [restrained](#Conditions_restrained) by this spell makes a second saving throw at the end of its turn.
On a success, the spell ends.
On a failure, the target is [petrified](#Conditions_petrified) for the duration.
If you maintain concentration for the maximum duration of the spell, this petrification is permanent.

Any pieces removed from a petrified creature are missing when the petrification ends.

**At Higher Levels.**
Target one additional creature when you cast this spell with an 8th-level spell slot.
