Until the spell ends, an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
Light emanating from the target may be any color.
Completely covering or enclosing the target with something that is not transparent blocks the light.
The spell ends when you use an action to dismiss it or if you cast it again.
