**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a forked twig) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Name or describe in detail an object familiar to you.
The spell reveals the general direction the object is in (south, east, northwest, and so on) if it exists within 1,000 feet of you.
This includes its current trajectory if itâ€™s traveling.

You may locate a specific object known to you, provided that you have observed it within 30 feet at least once.
You may also find the closest example of a certain type of object (for example an instrument, item of furniture, compass, or vase).

When there is any thickness of lead in the direct path between you and the object the spell is unable to find it.
