_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self (100-foot, 5 foot wide line) \
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A bolt of lightning arcs out from you in a direction you choose.
Each creature in the area takes `8d6` lightning damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw, half damage on success.
The lightning ignites flammable objects in its path that arenâ€™t worn or carried by another creature.

If the spell is stopped by an object at least as large as its width, it ends there unless it deals enough damage to break through.
When it does, it continues to the end of its area.

**At Higher Levels.**
Damage increases by `1d6` for every slot level above 3rd.
