You learn significant information about an object, creature, or location you name or describe.
This could range from the most up-to-date research, lore forgotten in old tales, or even previously unknown information.
The spell gives you additional, more detailed information if you already have some knowledge of the target.
The spell will not return any information for items not of legendary renown.

The knowledge you gain is always true, but may be obscured by metaphor, poetic language, or verse.
