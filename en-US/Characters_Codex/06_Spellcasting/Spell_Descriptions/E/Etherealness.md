_7th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

Until the spell ends or you use an action to end it, you enter the region of the [Ethereal Plane](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence) that borders your current plane.
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can move in any direction, but vertical movement is considered difficult terrain.
You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything looks desaturated and you can see no further than 60 feet.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other objects and creatures on that plane, so you can pass through obstacles on your plane of origin.
Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you without special magical abilities.

When the spell ends, you return to your plane of origin in the spot you currently occupy.
If you share the space of a solid object or creature, you move to the nearest unoccupied space and take 10 force damage for each 5 feet you are moved.

The spell fails if you cast it while you are already on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it.

**At Higher Levels.**
You can target up to 3 willing creatures within 10 feet (including you) for each slot level above 7th.
