_1st-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Constraining plants erupt from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point in range, wrapping vines and tendrils around creatures.
Until the spell ends, the area is difficult terrain.

When you cast the spell, each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained as the plants wrap around it.
A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

When the spell ends, the plants wither and disappear.
