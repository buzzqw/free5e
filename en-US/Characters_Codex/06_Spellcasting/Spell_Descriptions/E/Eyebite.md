_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast the spell and as an action on subsequent turns, you can force one creature within 60 feet of you that you can pinpoint and that can see to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted by one of the following effects for the duration.
You can’t target a creature after it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of the spell.

- **Asleep.**
  The target falls unconscious, waking if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to rouse it.
- **Panicked.**
  The target is frightened of you.
  On each of its turns, it uses its action to take the [Dash](#Combat_Actions_dash) action and move away from you if it can.
  If the target is at least 60 feet away from you and can’t see you, this effect ends.
- **Sickened.**
  The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
  At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.
