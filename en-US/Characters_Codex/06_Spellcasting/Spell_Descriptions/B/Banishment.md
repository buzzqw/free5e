_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature you can pinpoint must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it is banished to a featureless demiplane (or its native plane, if it is not native to this plane) and incapacitated.
At the end of this banishment, the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space).

At the end of each of its turns, a banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a –1 penalty for each round it has spent banished, ending the banishment on a success.
The banishment also ends if the spell ends early.
If the spell is maintained for its maximum duration, a target native to this plane ends the banishment, while a target native to a different plane doesn’t return.

**At Higher Levels.**
The duration of banishment on a native creature increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th.
