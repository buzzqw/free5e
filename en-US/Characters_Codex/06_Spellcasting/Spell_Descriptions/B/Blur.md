_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Creatures make attack rolls against you with disadvantage unless they have senses that allow them to perceive without sight or to see through illusions (like [parasense](#Exploration_Environment_parasense) or [truesight](#Exploration_Environment_truesight)).

**At Higher Levels.**
You may target an additional willing creature you can pinpoint within range for each slot level above 2nd.
Whenever an affected creature other than you is hit by an attack, the spell ends for that creature.
When using a higher level spell slot, increase the spellâ€™s range to 30 feet.
