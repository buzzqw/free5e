_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of slashing blades.
The wall can be up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick, and can either be a straight wall up to 100 feet long or a ringed wall of up to 60 feet in diameter.
The wall provides three-quarters cover and its area is difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the wall’s area or enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn, it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `6d10` slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 6th.
