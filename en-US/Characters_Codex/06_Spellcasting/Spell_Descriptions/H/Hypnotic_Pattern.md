**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure swirling hues that roil through the air for a moment before vanishing.
Creatures in the area that can perceive the effect must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [charmed](#Conditions_charmed).
A creature charmed by this spell becomes [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) and its speed is reduced to 0.

The effect ends on a creature when it takes damage or when another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.
