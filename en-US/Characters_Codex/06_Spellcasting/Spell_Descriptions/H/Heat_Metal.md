**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One metal object (such as a sword or a suit of metal armor) becomes oven hot.
Any creature touching the target takes `2d8` fire damage when the spell is cast.
Until the spell ends, on subsequent turns you can use a bonus action to inflict the same damage.
If a creature is holding or wearing the target and suffers damage, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it drops the target.
If a creature takes damage and does not or cannot drop the target, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
