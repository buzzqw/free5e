**Casting Time:** 1 action \

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Creatures you choose that are within the area shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on saving throws.
Attacks made against these creatures have disadvantage.
When a fiend or undead hits such a creature, the aura erupts into blinding light, forcing the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
