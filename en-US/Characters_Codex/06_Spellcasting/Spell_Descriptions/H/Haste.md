_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can pinpoint within range.
Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns.
That action can be used only to take the [Attack](#Combat_Actions_attack) (one weapon attack only), [Dash](#Combat_Actions_dash), [Disengage](#Combat_Actions_disengage), [Hide](#Combat_Actions_hide), or [Use an Object action](#Combat_Actions_use_an_object).
When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
