_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can pinpoint \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames.
The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.**
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
