_4th-level illusion_

**Range:** 300 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

You weave a veil over the natural terrain within the area, making it appear as different terrain.
This illusion affects sight, sound, and smell.
The illusory terrain can have completely different elevation and other characteristics to the original.
This spell does not affect structures, equipment, or creatures.

Any creature that enters the area might discover the illusion if they are unable to touch illusory terrain.
Otherwise, a creature can make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it.
On a successful save or if they discover the illusion, the creature sees the illusion superimposed over the actual terrain.

**At Higher Levels.**
The spell targets an additional 50-foot cube for each slot level above 4th.
