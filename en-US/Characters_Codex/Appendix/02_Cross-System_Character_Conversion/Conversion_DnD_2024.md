### Between 2024 D&D and Free5e

- **Species/Ancestry:**
  Keep ancestral ability score bonuses flexible.
  If converting to Free5e, add a Heritage that fits the character’s background.
- **Backgrounds and Cultures:**
  Assign a feat based on the character’s concept if moving to 2024.
  Swap the feat for a Culture that provides equivalent benefits if moving to Free5e.
- **Classes and Mastery:**
  Grant proficiency in an extra weapon type or allow a Fighting Style as a minor boost if converting a class with Mastery to Free5e.
- **Level-Based Class Adjustments:**
  Some class features shift levels between editions.
  Features tend to be more frequent in 2024 D&D, with adjustments at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 9th, and 13th levels.
  Free5e features follow the original 5e pattern but with class name changes.
- **Conversion:**
  - If a feature appears earlier in Free5e, delay its use until reaching that level in 2024.
  - If a feature is missing in Free5e, substitute an equivalent feature from another subclass or use an ASI.
