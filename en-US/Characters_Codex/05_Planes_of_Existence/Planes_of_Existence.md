# Planes of Existence

The multiverse consists of many interconnected planes, each with its own nature.
Most adventures take place on a **Material Plane**, one of many that can host different campaign settings.

Every creature and object has a **plane of origin**.
Surrounding the Material Plane are the **Inner Planes**, where elemental forces — air, earth, fire, water, and their interactions — exist in raw form.
Beyond them lie the **Outer Planes**, shaped by ideals and home to beings like celestials, fiends, and gods.
Between the Inner and Outer lie the **Feywild** and **Shadowfell**, parallel realms of vibrant life and morbid apathy.

The **Ethereal Plane** overlaps the Material and connects to the Inner Planes.
The **Astral Plane** links all others and enables planar travel.
Some spells and abilities interact with these planes, drawing on the structure of the multiverse.
